<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span></h2>


<p>I would agree with those who might maintain that no Introduction is
needed for this book on mushrooms. Nevertheless a word may not be out of
place for the inception of the work is out of the ordinary. Mr. Hard did
not decide that a book on this subject was needed and then set about
studying these interesting plants. He has observed them, collected them,
induced many friends to join in eating those which proved to be
palatable and delicious&mdash;really meddled for years with the various
kinds which are edible and otherwise, and then recently he has decided
to publish a book on his favorite subject. The interesting occupation of
photographing the mushrooms and the toadstools doubtless has contributed
largely to the determination culminating in the materialization of the
treatise.</p>

<p>If I have correctly apprehended the origin and the contributing causes,
we would expect this book to be different from the other books on
mushrooms&mdash;not of course in scope and purpose; but the instruction
and suggestions given, the descriptions and general remarks offered, the
wide range of forms depicted in word and picture, the whole make up of
the book in fact, will appeal to the people at large rather than the
college student in particular. The author does not write for the
specially educated few, but for the mass of intelligent
people&mdash;those who read and study, but who observe more; those who
are inclined to commune with nature as she displays herself in the glens
and glades, in the fields and forests, and who spend little, if any,
time chasing the forms or sketching the tissues that may be seen on the
narrow stage of a compound microscope.</p>

<p>The book then is for the beginner, and for all beginners; the college
student will find that this is the guide to use when he is ready to
begin studying the mushrooms; the teachers in the schools should all
begin to study mushrooms now, and for the purpose they will find this
book advantageous; the people who see mushrooms often but do not know
them may find here a book that really is a help.</p>

<p>We might wish for color photography when the subject is a delicately
tinted mushroom; but if with it we should lose detail in structure then
the wish would be renounced. The colors can be, approximately,
described, often not so the characteristic markings, shapes and forms.
The halftones from the photographs will, we anticipate, prove a valuable
feature of the book, especially if the plants be most carefully examined
before turning to the pictures. For half an hour the pages may be turned
and the illustrations enjoyed. That, however, would give one no real
knowledge of mushrooms. If such use only is made of the pictures, better
had they never been prepared by Mr. Hard and his friends. But if a
charming little toadstool, a delicately colored mushroom, a stately
agaric, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span> carefully removed from the bed of loam, the decaying
stump, or the old tree-trunk, then turned over and over again, and
upside down, every part scrutinized, the structure in every detail
attentively regarded&mdash;not with repugnant feeling, rather with a
sympathetic interest that should naturally find all organisms inhabiting
our globe&mdash;then in due time coming to the picture, a real picture,
in the book, it must surely bring both pleasure and profit. Ponder the
suggestion. Then, to conclude in a word, if Mr. Hard's book will induce
people to <i>learn</i> and <i>enjoy</i> the mushrooms that we have, it will be a
success, and great will be his reward.</p>

<h2>AUTHOR'S NOTE</h2>

<p class="center"><b>IN MEMORIAM</b></p>


<p>It is with feelings of profound sadness that I am impelled to supplement
the above Introduction by a brief tribute to the memory of that genial gentleman
and lovable companion, as well as enthusiastic scientist, the late Dr. W. A.
Kellerman.</p>

<p>Spending his life in the pursuit of science, the Angel of Death overtook
him while still in search for wider knowledge of Nature and her works,
and with icy fingers sealed the lids over eyes ever on the alert for the
discovery of hidden truths.</p>

<p>Quiet, reticent, and unassuming, it was given to but few to know the
great-hearted, unselfish sweetness of nature underlying his whole life.
Yet the scientific world in general and Nature students especially,
recognize in Dr. Kellerman's death a loss long to be regretted and not
soon to be repaired.</p>

<p>The foregoing "Introduction" from his pen was one of the latest, if not
the last of his public writings, done but a few weeks before being
stricken with the fatal fever which fell upon him in the forests of
Guatemala, and so quickly ended his earthly hopes and aspirations.</p>

<p>It seems doubly sad that one so well and widely known in his life should
be called upon to lay its burdens and its pleasures down while so far
away from all who knew and loved him well; and to rest at last among
strangers in a strange land.</p>

<p>To this beloved friend and companion of so many pleasant days in woods
and fields the author of this book desires to pay the tribute of a
loving remembrance and heartfelt appreciation.</p>

<p>Botany and geology have been favorite studies of the author since
leaving college, thanks to Dr. Nelson, who lives in the hearts of all
his students. He, by his teachings, made these subjects so attractive
and interesting that by one, at least, every spare moment has been given
to following up the studies of botany and paleontology. But the
mycological part of botany was brought practically to the author's
attention by the Bohemian children at Salem, Ohio, at the same time
arousing a desire to know the scientific side of the subject and thus to
be able to help the many who were seeking a personal knowledge of these
interesting plants.</p>

<p>Every teacher should be able to open the doors of Nature to his pupils
that they may see her varied handiwork, and, as far as possible, assist
in removing the mist from their eyes that they may see clearly the
beauties of meadow, wood or hillside.</p>

<p>In beginning the fuller study of the subject the writer labored at great
disadvantage because, for a number of years, there was but little
available literature. Every book written upon this subject, in this
country, was purchased as soon as it came out and all have been very
helpful.</p>

<p>The study has been a very great pleasure, and some very delightful
friendships have been made while in search for as great a variety of
species as possible.</p>

<p>For a number of years the object was simply to become familiar with the
different genera and species, and no photographs of specimens were made.
This was a great mistake; for, after it was determined to bring out this
work, it seemed impossible to find many of the plants which the author
had previously found in other parts of the state.</p>

<p>However, this failure has been very largely overcome through the
generous courtesy of his esteemed friends,&mdash;Mr. C. G. Lloyd, of
Cincinnati; Dr. Fisher, of Detroit; Prof. Beardslee, of Ashville, N. C.;
Prof. B. O. Longyear, of Ft. Collins, Col., and Dr. Kellerman, of Ohio
State University,&mdash;who have most kindly furnished photographs
representing those species found earlier in other parts of the state.
The species represented here have all been found in this state within
the past few years.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span></p>

<p>The writer is under great obligation to Prof. Atkinson, of Cornell
University, for his very great assistance and encouragement in the study
of mycology. His patience in examining and determining plants sent him
is more fully appreciated than can be expressed here. Dr. William
Herbst, Trexlertown, Pa., has helped to solve many difficult problems;
so also have Mr. Lloyd, Prof. Morgan, Capt. McIlvaine and Dr. Charles H.
Peck, State Botanist of New York.</p>

<p>The aim of the book has been to describe the species, as far as
possible, in terms that will be readily understood by the general
reader; and it is hoped that the larger number of illustrations will
make the book helpful to those who are anxious to become acquainted with
a part of botany so little studied in our schools and colleges.</p>

<p>No pains have been spared to get as representative specimens as it was
possible to find. A careful study of the illustrations of the plants
will, in most cases, very greatly assist the student in determining the
classification of the plant when found; but the illustration should not
be wholly relied upon, especially in the study of Boleti. The
description should be carefully studied to see if it tallies with the
characteristics of the plant in hand.</p>

<p>In many plants where notes had not been taken or had been lost, the
descriptions given by the parties naming the plants were used. This is
notably so of many of the Boleti. The author felt that Dr. Peck's
descriptions would be more accurate and complete, hence they were used,
giving him credit.</p>

<p>Care has been taken to give the translation of names and to show why the
plant was so called. It is always a wonder to the uninitiated how the
Latin name is remembered, but when students see that the name includes
some prominent characteristic of the plant and thus discover its
applicability, its recollection becomes comparatively easy.</p>

<p>The habitat and time of growth of each plant is given, also its
edibility. The author was urged by his many friends throughout the
state, while in institute work and frequently talking upon this subject,
to give them a book that would assist them in becoming familiar with the
common mushrooms of their vicinity. The request has been complied with.</p>

<p>It is hoped that the work will be as helpful as it has been pleasant to
perform.</p>

<p><b>WHY STUDY MUSHROOMS.</b> Some years ago, while in charge of the schools of
Salem, Ohio, we had worked up quite a general interest in the study of
botany. It was my practice to go out every day after flowers, especially
the rarer ones, of which there were many in this county, and bring in
specimens for the classes. There was in the city a wire nail mill,
running day and night, whose proprietors brought over, from time to
time, large numbers of Bohemians as workers in the mill. Very
frequently, when driving to the country early in the morning, I found
the boys and girls of these Bohemian families searching the woods,
fields and pastures at some distance from town, although they had not
been in this country more than a week or two and could not speak a word
of English. I soon found that they were gathering mushrooms of various
kinds and taking them home for food material. They could not tell me how
they knew them, but I quickly learned that they knew them from their
general characteristics,&mdash;in fact, they knew them as we know people
and flowers.</p>

<p>I resolved to know something of the subject myself. I had no literature
on mycology, and, at that time, there seemed to be little obtainable.
About that time there appeared in Harper's Monthly an article by W.
Hamilton Gibson upon Edible Toadstools and Mushrooms&mdash;an article
which I thoroughly devoured, soon after purchasing his book upon the
subject.</p>

<p>Salem, Ohio, was a very fertile locality for mushrooms and it was not
long till I was surprised at the number that I really knew. I remembered
that where there is a will there is a way.</p>

<p>In 1897 I moved to Bowling Green, Ohio; there I found many species which
I had found about Salem, Ohio, but the extremely rich soil, heavy timber
and numerous old lake beaches seemed to furnish a larger variety, so
that I added many more to my list. After remaining three years in
Bowling Green, making delightful acquaintance with the good people of
that city as well as with the flowers and mushrooms of Wood county,
Providence placed me in Sidney, Ohio, where I found many new species of
fungi and renewed my acquaintance with many of those formerly met.</p>

<p>Since coming to Chillicothe I have tried to have the plants photographed
as I have found them, but having to depend upon a photographer I could
not always do this. I have not found in this vicinity many that I have
found elsewhere in the state, although I have found many new things
here, a fact which I attribute to the hilly nature of the county. For
prints of many varieties of fungi obtained before coming here, I am
indebted to my friends. I should advise any one intending to make a
study of this subject to have all specimens photographed as soon as they
are identified, thus fixing the species for future reference.</p>

<p>It seems to me that every school teacher should know something of
mycology.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> Some of my teachers have during the past year made quite
a study of this interesting subject, and I have found that their pupils
kept them busy in identifying their finds. Their lists of genera and
species, as exhibited on the blackboards at the close of the season were
quite long. I found from my Bohemian boys and girls that their teachers
in their native country had opened for them the door to this very useful
knowledge. Observation has proven to me conclusively that there is a
large and increasing interest in this subject throughout the greater
part of Ohio.</p>

<p>Every professional man needs a hobby which he may mount in his hours of
relaxation, and I am quite sure there is no field that offers better
inducement for a canter than the subject of botany, and especially this
particular department of botanical work.</p>

<p>I have a friend, a professional man who has an eye and a heart for all
the beauties of nature. After hours of confinement in his office at
close and critical work he is always anxious for a ramble over the
hillsides and through the woods, and when we find anything new he seems
to enjoy it beyond measure.</p>

<p>Many ministers of the gospel have become famous in the mycological
world. The names of Rev. Lewis Schweiwitz, of Bethlehem, Pa.; Rev. M. J.
Berkeley and Rev. John Stevenson, of England, will live as long as
botany is known to mankind. Their influence for good and helpfulness to
their fellowmen will be everlasting.</p>

<p>With such an inspiration, how quickly one is lost to all business cares,
and how free and life-giving are the fields, the meadows and the woods,
so that one must exclaim with Prof. Henry Willey in his "Introduction to
the Study of the Lichen":</p>

<h3><a name="mus" id="mus"></a>MUSHROOMS AND TOADSTOOLS<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></h3>

<p><b>HOW TO TELL MUSHROOMS FROM TOADSTOOLS.</b> In all probability
no student of mycology has any one query more frequently or persistently
pressed upon his attention than the question, "How do you tell a toadstool from
a mushroom?"&mdash;or if in the woods or fields, in search for new species, with an
uninitiated comrade, he has frequently to decide whether a certain specimen "is
a mushroom or a toadstool," so firmly fixed is the idea that one class of fungi&mdash;the
toadstools&mdash;are poisonous, and the other&mdash;the mushrooms&mdash;are edible and
altogether desirable; and these inquiring minds frequently seem really disappointed
at being told that they are one and the same thing; that there are edible
toadstools and mushrooms, and poisonous mushrooms and toadstools; that in
short a toadstool is really a mushroom and a mushroom is only a toadstool after all.</p>

<p>Hence the questions with the beginner is, how he may tell a poisonous
fungus from an edible one. There is but one answer to this question, and that
is that he must thoroughly learn both genera and species, studying each till he
knows its special features as he does those of his most familiar friends.</p>

<p>Certain species have been tested by a number of people and found to be
perfectly safe and savory; on the other hand, there are species under various
genera which, if not actually poisonous, are at least deleterious.</p>

<p>It is the province of all books on fungi to assist the student in separating
the plants into genera and species; in this work special attention has been given
to distinguishing between the edible and the poisonous species. There are a
few species such as Gyromitra esculenta, Lepiota Morgani, Clitocybe illudens,
etc., which when eaten by certain persons will cause sickness soon after eating,
while others will escape any disagreeable effects. Chemically speaking, they are
not poisonous, but simply refuse to be assimilated in some stomachs. It is best
to avoid all such.</p>


<p><b>HOW MUSHROOMS GROW.</b> There is a strong notion that mushrooms
grow very quickly, springing up in a single night. This is erroneous. It is
true that after they have reached the button stage they develop very quickly;
or in the case of those that spring from a mature egg, develop so rapidly that
you can plainly see the motion of the upward growth, but the development of
the button from the <ins title="myselium in original.">mycelium</ins> or spawn takes time&mdash;weeks, months, and even
years. It would be very difficult to tell the age of many of our tree fungi.</p>


<p><b>HOW TO LEARN MUSHROOMS.</b> If the beginner will avoid all Amanitas
and perhaps some of the Boleti he need not be much worried in regard to the
safety of other species.</p>

<p>There are three ways by which he can become familiar with the edible kinds.
The first is the physiological test suggested by Mr. Gibson in his book. It consists
in chewing a small morsel and then spitting it out without swallowing the
juice; if no important symptoms arise within twenty-four hours, another bit may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
be chewed, this time swallowing a small portion of the juice. Should no irritation
be experienced after another period of waiting, a still larger piece may be
tried. I always sample a new plant carefully, and thus am often able to establish
the fact of its edibility before being able to locate it in its proper species. This
fall I found for the first time Tricholoma columbetta; it was some time after I
had proven it an edible mushroom before I had settled upon its name. A better
way, perhaps, is to cook them and feed them to your cat and watch the result.</p>

<p>Another way is to have a friend who knows the plants go with you, and
thus you learn under a teacher as a pupil learns in school. This is the quickest
way to gain a knowledge of plants of any kind, but it is difficult to find a competent
teacher.</p>

<p>Still another way, and one that is open to all, is to gain a knowledge of a
few species and through their description become familiar with the terms used
in describing a mushroom; this done, the way is open, if you have a book containing
illustrations and descriptions of the most common plants. Do not be in
a hurry to get the names of all the plants, and do not make use of any about
which you are not absolutely sure. In gathering mushrooms to eat, do not put
into your basket with those you intend to eat a single mushroom of whose edible
qualities you have any doubt. If you have the least doubt about it, discard it,
or put it in another basket.</p>

<p>There are no fixed rules by which you can tell a poisonous from an edible
mushroom. I found a friend of mine eating Lepiota naucina, not even knowing
to what genus it belonged, simply because she could peel it. I told her that the
most deadly mushroom can be peeled just as readily. Nor is there anything
more valuable in the silver spoon test in which Mr. Gibson's old lady put so
much confidence. Some say, do not eat any that have an acrid taste; many are
edible whose taste is quite acrid. Others say, do not eat any whose juice or
milk is white, but this would discard a number of Lactarii that are quite good.
There is nothing in the white gills and hollow stem theory. It is true that the
Amanita has both, but it must be known by other characteristics. Again we are
told to avoid such as have a viscid cap, or those that change color quickly; this
is too sweeping a condemnation for it would cut out several very good species.
I think I may safely say there is no known rule by which the good can be distinguished
from the bad. The only safe way is to know each species by its own
individual peculiarities&mdash;to know them as we know our friends.</p>

<p>The student of mycology has before him a description of each species, which
must tally with the plant in hand and which will soon render him familiar with
the different features of the various genera and species, so he can recognize
them as readily as the features of his best friends.</p>


<p><a name="what" id="what"></a><b>WHAT ANYONE MAY EAT.</b> In the spring of the year there comes with
the earliest flowers a mushroom so strongly characteristic in all its forms that
no one will fail to recognize it. It is the common morel or sponge mushroom.
None of them are known to be harmful, hence here the beginner can safely trust
his judgment. While he is gathering morels to eat he will soon begin to distinguish
the different species of the genera. From May till frost the different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
kinds of puff-balls will appear. All puff-balls are good while their interior
remains white. They are never poisonous, but when the flesh has begun to turn
yellow it is very bitter. The oyster mushroom is found from March to December
and is always a very acceptable mushroom. The Fairy Rings are easily recognized
and can be found in any old pasture during wet weather from June to
October. In seasonable weather they are usually very plentiful. The common
meadow mushroom is found from September to frost. It is known by its pink
gills and meaty cap. There is a mushroom with pink gills found in streets,
along the pavements and among the cobble stones. The stems are short and the
caps are very meaty. It is A. rodmani. These are found in May and
June. The horse mushroom has pink gills and may be found from June
to September. The Russulas, found from July to October, are generally good.
A few should be avoided because of their acrid taste or their strong odor. There
is no time from early spring till freezing weather when you can not find mushrooms,
if the weather is at all favorable. I have given the habitat and the time
when each species can be found. I should recommend a careful study of these
two points. Read the descriptions of plants which grow in certain places and
at certain times, and you will generally be rewarded, if you follow out the description
and the season is favorable.</p>


<p><a name="how" id="how"></a><b>HOW TO PRESERVE MUSHROOMS.</b> Many can be dried for winter
use, such as the Morels, Marasmius oreades, Boletus edulis, Boletus edulis, va.
clavipes, and a number of others. My wife has very successfully canned a
number of species, notably Lycoperdon pyriforme, Pleurotus ostreatus and Tricholoma
personatum. The mushrooms were carefully picked over and washed,
let stand in salt water for about five minutes, in order to free them of any insect-life
which may be in the gills, then drained, cut into pieces small enough to go
into the jars easily. Each jar was packed as full as possible with mushrooms
and filled up with water salt enough to flavor the mushroom properly. Then
put into a kettle of cold water on the stove, the lids being loosely placed on the
top, and allowed to cook for an hour or more after the water in the kettle begins
to boil. The tops were then fastened on securely and after trying the jars to
see if there was any leak, they were set away in a cool, dark place.</p>

<p>In canning puff-balls they should be carefully washed and sliced, being sure
that they are perfectly white all through. They do not need to stand in salt
water before packing in the jar as do those mushrooms which have gills. Otherwise
they were canned as the Tricholoma and oyster mushroom. Any edible
mushroom can easily be kept for winter use by canning. Use glass jars with
glass tops.</p>


<h3><a name="ter" id="ter"></a>TERMS USED</h3>

<p><b>SOME OF THE MOST COMMON TERMS USED.</b> In describing mushrooms
it is necessary to use certain terms, and it will be incumbent upon anyone
who wishes to become familiar with this part of botanical work to understand
thoroughly the terms used in describing the plants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>The substance of all mushrooms is either fleshy, membranaceous, or corky.
The <i>pileus</i> or <i>cap</i> is the expanded part, which may be either sessile or supported
by a stem. The pileus is not made up of cellular tissue as in flowering plants,
but of myriads of interwoven threads or hyphae. This structure of the pileus
will become evident at once if a thin portion of the cap is placed under the
microscope.</p>

<p>The <i>gills</i> or <i>lamellÃ¦</i> are thin plates or membranes radiating from the stem to
the margin of the cap. When they are attached squarely and firmly to the stem
they are said to be <i>adnate</i>. If they are attached only by a part of the width of
the gills, they are <i>adnexed</i>. Should they extend down on the stem, they are
<i>decurrent</i>. They are <i>free</i> when they are not attached to the stem. Frequently
the lower edge is notched at, or near, the stem and in this case they are said to
be <i>emarginate</i> or <i>sinuate</i>.</p>

mushroom which produces its spores on the ends of cells called basidium.
(a) Spores, (b) basidium, (c) sterile cells.</p>
</div>

<p>In some genera the lower surface of the cap is full of pores instead of gills;
in other genera the lower surface is crowded with teeth; in still others the surface
is smooth, as in the Stereums. The gills, pores and teeth afford a foundation
for the hymenium or fruit-bearing surface. It will be readily seen that the
gills, pores and teeth simply expose in a very economical way the greatest possible
spore-bearing surface.</p>

<p>If a section of the gills be examined by a microscope, it will be observed
that upon both sides of the surface are extended hymenial layers. The <i>hymenium</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
consists of elongated cells or basidia (singular, basidium) more or less club-shaped.
Figure 2 will show how these basidia appear on the hymenial layer
when strongly magnified. It will be seen that they are placed side by side and
are perpendicular to the surface of the gills. Upon each of these basidia are in
some species two, usually four, slender projections upon which the spores are
produced. In Figure 2 a number of sterile cells will be seen which resemble the
basidia except that the latter bear four sterigmata upon which the spores rest.
Among these basidia and sterile cells will frequently be seen an overgrown
bladder-like sterile basidium which projects beyond the rest of the hymenium,
and whose use is not as yet fully known. They are called cystidia (singular,
cystidium). They are never numerous, but they are scattered over the entire
surface, becoming more numerous along the edge of the gills. When they are
colored, they change the appearance of the gills.</p>

</div>

<p>The spores are the seeds of the mushroom. They are of various sizes and
shapes, with a variety of surface markings. They are very small, as fine as dust,
and invisible to the naked eye, except as they are seen in masses on the grass,
on the ground, or on logs, or in a spore print. It is the object of every fungus
to produce spores. Some fall on the parent host or upon the ground. Others
are wafted away by every rise of the wind and carried for days and finally settle
down, it may be, in other states and continents from those in which they started.
Millions perish because of not finding a suitable resting place. Those spores<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
that do find a favorable resting-place, under right conditions, will begin to germinate
by sending out a slender thread-like filament, or hyphÃ¦, which at once
branches out in search of food material, and which always forms a more or
less felted mass, called mycelium. When first formed the hyphÃ¦ are continuous
and ramify through the nourishing substratum from which there arises afterward
a spore-bearing growth known as the sporocarp or young mushroom. This
vegetative part of the fungus is usually hidden in the soil, or in decayed wood,
or vegetable matter. In Figure 3 is a representation of the mycelium of the
small pear-shaped puff-ball with a number of small white knobs marking the
beginning of the puff-ball. The mycelium exposed here is very similar to the
mycelium of all mushrooms.</p>

<p>In the pore-bearing genera
the hymenium lines the vertical
pores; in teeth-bearing fungi it
lines the surface of each tooth,
or is spread out over the smooth
surface of the Stereum.</p>

<p>The development of the spores
is quite interesting. The young
basidia as seen in Figure 2 are
filled with a granular protoplasm.
Soon small projections,
called sterigma (plural, sterigmata),
make their appearance on
the ends of the basidia and the
protoplasm passes into them.
Each projection or sterigma
soon swells at its extremity into
a bladder-like body, the young
spore, and, as they enlarge, the
protoplasm of the basidium is
passed into them. When the
four spores are full grown they
have consumed all the protoplasm
in the basidium. The
spores soon separate by a transverse
partition and fall off. All
spores of the Hymenomycetous
fungi are arranged and produced
in a similar manner, with
their spore-bearing surface exposed
early in life by the rupture
of the universal veil.</p>


<p>In the puff-balls the spores
are arranged in the same way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
but the hymenium is inclosed within an outer sack. When the spores are ripe
the case is ruptured and the spores escape into the air as a dusty powder. The
puff-balls, therefore, belong to the Gastromycetous fungi because its spores are
inclosed in a pouch until they are matured.</p>

<p>Another very large group of
fungi is the Ascomycetes, or sac
fungi. It is very easily determined
because all of its members
develop their spores inside
of small membranous sacs or
asci. These asci are generally
intermixed with slender, empty
asci, or sterile cells, called paraphyses.
These asci are variously
shaped bodies and are known in
different orders by different
names, such as ascoma, apothecium,
perithecium, and receptacle.
The Ascomycetes often
include among their numbers
fungi ranging in size from microscopic
one-celled plants to
quite large and very beautiful
specimens. To this group belong
the great number of small
fungi producing the various
plant diseases.</p>

<p>In a work of this kind especial
attention is naturally given to
the order of Discomycetes or cup
fungi. This order is very large
and is so called because so many
of the plants are cup shaped.
These cups vary greatly in size
and form; some are so small
that it requires a lens to examine
them; some are saucer-shaped;
some are like goblets, and some
resemble beakers of various shapes. The saddle fungi and morels belong to this
order. Here the sac surface is often convoluted, lobed, and ridged, in order to
afford a greater sac-bearing surface.</p>

</div>

<p>In the mushrooms, puff-balls, etc., we find the spores were borne on the
ends of basidia, usually four spores on each. In this group the spores are
formed in minute club-shaped sacs, known as asci (singular, ascus). These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
asci are long, cylindrical sacs, standing side by side, perpendicular to the fruiting
surface. Figure 4 will illustrate their position together with the sterile cells on
the fruiting surface of one of the morels. They usually have eight spores in
each sac or ascus.</p>

<p>The stem of the mushroom is usually in the center of the cap, yet it may be
eccentric or lateral; when it is wanting, the pileus is said to be sessile. The
stem is solid when it is fleshy throughout, or hollow when it has a central cavity,
or stuffed when the interior is filled with pithy substance. The stems are either
fleshy or cartilaginous. When the former, it is of the same consistency as the
pileus. If the latter, its consistency is always different from the pileus, resembling
cartilage. The stem of the Tricholoma affords a good example of the
fleshy stemmed mushroom, and that of the Marasmius illustrates the cartilaginous.</p>

</div>

<p>If the cap or stem of a mushroom is examined with a microscope of high
magnifying power it will be found to be made up of a continuation of the mycelial
filaments, interlaced and interwoven, branching, and the tubular filaments
often delicately divided, giving the appearance of cells. Figure 5 represents
a small portion of a Morel stem highly magnified showing the cell filaments.
In soft fungi the mycelial threads are more loosely woven and have thin walls
with fewer partitions.</p>

<p>The <i>veil</i> is a thin sheet of mycelial threads covering the gills, sometimes
remaining on the stem, forming a <i>ring</i> or <i>annulus</i>. This sometimes remains for
a time on the margin of the cap when it is said to be <i>appendiculate</i>. Sometimes
it resembles a spider's web when it is called <i>arachnoid</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>volva</i> is a universal wrapper, surrounding the entire plant when young,
but which is soon ruptured, leaving a trace in the form of scales on the cap and
a sheath around the base of the stem, or breaking up into scales or a scaly ring
at the base of the stem. All plants having this universal volva should be avoided,
further than for the purpose of study. Care should be taken that, in their young
state, they are not mistaken for puff-balls. Frequently when found in the egg
state they resemble a small puff-ball. Figure 6 represents a section of an Amanita
in the egg-state and also the Gemmed puff-ball. As soon as a section is
made and carefully examined the structure of the inside will reveal the plant at
once. There is but little danger of confusing the egg stage of an Amanita with
the puff-ball, for they resemble each other only in their oval shape, and not in
the least in their marking on the surface.</p>

<p><a name="wha" id="wha"></a><b>WHAT IS A FUNGUS OR A MUSHROOM?</b> It is a cellular, flowerless
plant, nourished by the mycelium which permeates the soil or other substances
on which the fungus or mushroom grows. All fungi are either parasites or
saprophytes which have lost their chlorophyll, and are incapable of supporting
an independent existence.</p>

<p>There is a vast number of genera and species, and many have the parasitic
habit which causes them to enter the bodies of other plants and of animals.
For this reason all fungi are of economic importance, especially the microscopic
forms classed under the head of Bacteria. Some recent writers are inclined to
separate the Bacteria and slime-molds from the fungus group, and call them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
fungus animals. However this may be, they are true plants and have many of
the characteristics of the fungi. They may differ from the fungi in their vegetative
functions, yet they have so many things in common that I am inclined to place
them under this group.</p>

<p>Many, such as the yeast fungus, the various fermentative fungi, and the
Bacteria concerned in the process of decomposition, are indeed very useful. The
enrichment and preparation of soils for the uses of higher plants, effected by
Bacteria, are very important services.</p>


<p>Parasites derive their nourishment from living plants and animals. They
are so constituted that when their nourishing threads come within range of the
living plant they answer a certain impulse by sending out special threads, enveloping
the host and absorbing nutrition. Saprophitic plants do not experience this
reaction from the living plants. They are compelled to get their nourishment
from decaying products of plants or animals, consequently they live in rich ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
or leaf mold, on decayed wood, or on dung. Parasites are usually small, being
limited by their host. Saprophytes are not thus limited for food supply and it is
possible to build up large plants such as the common mushroom group, puff-balls,
etc.</p>

<p>The spores are the seeds or reproductive bodies of the mushroom. They
are very fine, and invisible to the naked eye except when collected together in great
masses. Underneath mushrooms, frequently, the grass or wood will be white
or plainly discolored from the spores. The hymenium is the surface or part
of the plant which bears the spores. The hymenophore is the part which supports
the hymenium.</p>

<p>In the common mushroom, and in fact many others, the spores develop on
a certain club-like cell, called basidium (plural, basidia), on each of which four
spores usually develop. In morels these cells are elongated into cylindrical
membranous sacs called asci, in each of which eight spores are usually developed.
The spores will be found of various colors, shapes, and sizes, a fact which will
be of great assistance to the student in locating strange species and genera. In
germination the spores send out slender threads which Botanists call mycelium,
but which common readers know as spawn.</p>

<p>The method and place of spore development furnish a basis for the classification
of fungi. The best way to acquire a thorough knowledge of both our edible
and poisonous mushrooms is to study them in the light of the primary characters
employed in their classification and their natural relation to each other.</p>

<p>There is a wide difference of opinion as to the classification of mushrooms.
Perhaps the most simple and satisfactory is that of Underwood and Cook. They
arrange them under six groups:</p>

<p><a name="six" id="six"></a></p>

<ol>
<li>Basidiomycetes&mdash;those in which the spores or reproductive bodies
are naked or external as shown in illustration 2 on page 15.</li>

<li>Ascomycetes&mdash;those in which the spores are inclosed in sacs or
asci. These sacs are very clearly represented in illustration
Figure 4 on page 18. This will include the Morels, PezizÃ¦,
Pyrenomycetes, TuberaceÃ¦, Sphairiacei, etc.</li>

<li>Physcomycetes&mdash;including the Mucorini, SaprolegniaceÃ¦, and
PeronosporeÃ¦. Potato rot and downy mildew on grape vines belong
to this family.</li>

<li>Myxomycetes&mdash;Slime moulds.</li>

<li>Saccharomycetes&mdash;Yeast fungi.</li>

<li>Schizomycetes&mdash;are minute, unicellular Protophytes which reproduce

<h4><span class="smcap">Class, Fungi&mdash;Sub-Class, Basidiomycetes.</span></h4>

<p>This class will include all gill-bearing fungi, Polyporus, Boletus, Hydnum, etc.</p>

<p>Fungi of this class are divided into four natural groups:</p>


<ol>
<li>Hymenomycetes.</li>
<li>Gasteromycetes.</li>
<li>UredinÃ¦.</li>
<li>UstilagineÃ¦.</li>
</ol>


<h4><a name="gro" id="gro"></a><span class="smcap">Group 1&mdash;Hymenomycetes.</span></h4>

<p>Under this group will be placed all fungi composed of membranes, fleshy,
woody, or gelatinous, whether growing on the ground or on wood. The hymenium,
or spore-bearing surface, is external at an early stage in the life of the
plant. The spores are borne on basidia as explained in Figure 2, page 6.
When the spores ripen they fall to the ground or are carried by the wind to a
host that presents all the conditions necessary for germination; there they produce
the mycelia or white thread-like vines that one may have noticed in plowing sod, in
old chip piles, or decayed wood. If one will examine these threads there will be
found small knots which will in time develop into the full grown mushroom.
Hymenomycetes are divided into six families:</p>


<ol>
<li>AgaricaceÃ¦. Hymenium with gills.</li>
<li>PolyporaceÃ¦. Hymenium with pores.</li>
<li>HydnaceÃ¦. Hymenium with spines.</li>
<li>ThelephoraceÃ¦. Hymenium horizontal and mostly on the under surface.</li>
<li>ClavariaceÃ¦. Hymenium on a smooth club-shaped surface.</li>
<li>TremellaceÃ¦. Hymenium even and superior. Gelatinous fungi.</li>
</ol>

</div>

<p>In the AgaricaceÃ¦ or common mushrooms, and in all other of similar structure,
the spore-producing membranes are found on the under surface of the cap.
They consist of thin lamellÃ¦, or gills, attached by the upper edge to the cap and
extending from the stem to the margin of the cap. Very frequently that space
may be entirely utilized by shorter lamellÃ¦, or gills, intervening between the longer,
especially toward the margin of the cap. In a few species where the stem seems
to be wanting, or where it is attached to the side of the cap, the lamellÃ¦, or gills,
radiate from the point of attachment or from the lateral stem to other parts of the
circumference of the cap. Berkeley gives the following characteristics:
Hymenium, inferior, spread over easily divisible gills or plates, radiating from
a center or stem, which may be either simple or branched.</p>

<p>This family includes the following genera:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<ol>
<li>Agaricus&mdash;Gills, not melting, edge acute; including all the
sub-genera which have been elevated to the rank of genera.</li>

<li>Coprinus&mdash;Gills deliquescent, spores black.</li>

<li>Cortinarius&mdash;Gills persistent, veil spider-web-like, terrestrial.</li>

<li>Paxillus&mdash;Gills separating from the hymenophorum and decurrent.</li>

<li>Gomphidius&mdash;Gills branched and decurrent, pileus top-shaped.</li>

<li>Bolbitius&mdash;Gills becoming moist, spores colored.</li>

<li>Lactarius&mdash;Gills milky, terrestrial.</li>

<li>Russula&mdash;Gills equal, rigid, and brittle, terrestrial.</li>

<li>Marasmius&mdash;Gills thick, tough, hymenium dry.</li>

<li>Hygrophorus&mdash;Stem confluent with the hymenophorum; gills sharp
edged.</li>

<li>Cantharellus&mdash;Gills thick, branched, rounded edge.</li>

<li>Lentinus&mdash;Pileus hairy, hard, tough; gills, tough, unequal,
toothed; on logs and stumps.</li>

<li>Lenzites&mdash;Whole plant corky; gills simple or branched.</li>

<li>Trogia&mdash;Gills venose, fold-like, channelled.</li>

<li>Panus&mdash;Gills corky, with acute edge.</li>

<li>Nyctalis&mdash;Veil universal; gills broad, often parasitic.</li>

<li>Schizophyllum&mdash;Gills corky, split longitudinally.</li>

<li>Xerotus&mdash;Gills tough, fold-like.</li>
</ol>

<p>Therefore the gill-bearing fungi are known under the family name, AgaricaceÃ¦,
or more generally
known as Agarics.</p>

<p><a name="spo" id="spo"></a>This family is divided into
five series, according to the
color of their spores. The
spores when seen in masses
possess certain colors, white,
rosy, rusty, purple-brown and
black. Therefore the first and
most important part to be determined
in locating a mushroom
is to ascertain the color
of the spores. To do this,
take a fresh, perfect, and fully
developed specimen, remove
the stem from the cap. Place
the cap with the gills downward
on the surface of dark
velvety paper, if you suspect
the spores to be white. Invert
a finger bowl or a bell glass
over the cap to keep the air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
from blowing the spores away. If the spores should be colored, white paper
should be used. If the specimen is left too long the spore deposit will continue
upward between the gills and it may reach an eighth of an inch in height, in
which case if great care is taken in removing the cap there will be a perfect likeness
of the gills and also the color of the spores.</p>

<p>There are two ways of making these spore prints quite permanent. First
take a piece of thin rice paper, muscilage it and allow it to dry, then proceed as
above. In this way the print will stand handling quite a little. Another way,
and that used to prepare the spore-prints in these photographs, is to obtain the
spore-print upon Japanese paper as in the preceding method, then by an atomizer
spray the print gently and carefully with a fixative such as is used in fixing
charcoal drawings. Success in
making spore-prints requires both
time and care, but the satisfaction
they give is ample recompense for
the trouble. It is more difficult to
obtain good prints from the white-spored
mushrooms than from those
bearing colored spores, because it
is hard to obtain a black paper
having a dull velvety surface, and
the spores will not adhere well to
a smooth-finished, glossy paper.
For the prints illustrated I am indebted
to Mrs. Blackford.</p>

<p>If the plant is dry it is well to
moisten the fingerbowl or bell-glass
on the inside before placing
it over the mushroom. The spores
of Boleti, and, indeed, all fungi
can be caught and fixed in the
same way.</p>

<p>From the study of these spore-prints
we shall find five different colors of spores. This family is, therefore,
divided into five series, determined by the color of the spores, which are always
constant in color, size and shape.</p>

<p>The five series will be treated in the following order:</p>


<ol>
<li>The white-spored Agarics.</li>
<li>The rosy-spored Agarics.</li>
<li>The rusty-spored Agarics.</li>
<li>The purple-brown-spored Agarics.</li>
<li>The black-spored Agarics.</li>
</ol>


<h3><a name="ana" id="ana"></a><b>ANALYTICAL KEY.</b><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></h3>

<p>This key is largely based upon
Cooke's analytical key. Its use will
help to locate the plant in hand in the
genus to which it belongs.</p>

<p>The first thing the student should
do is to determine the color of the
spore if it is not evident. This is best
done according to the plan described
on page 15.</p>

<p>The plant should be fresh and mature.
Careful attention should be
given to different stages of development.
The habit of the plant should
be considered; then, as soon as the
color of the spores is determined, it
will be an easy matter to locate the
genus by means of the key.</p>

THE WHITE-SPORED AGARICS.</h2>


<p>The species bearing the white spores seem to be higher in type than those
producing colored spores. Most of the former are firmer, while the black spored
specimens soon deliquesce. The white spores are usually oval, sometimes round,
and in many cases quite spiny. All white-spored specimens will be found in
clean places.</p>


<h3><i>Amanita. Pers.</i></h3>

<p><i>Amanita</i> is supposed to be derived from Mount Amanus, an ancient name
of a range separating Cilicia from Syria. It is supposed that Galen first brought
specimens of this fungus from that region.</p>

<p>The genus <i>Amanita</i> has both a volva and veil. The spores are white and
the stem is readily separable from the cap. The volva is universal at first,
enveloping the young plant, yet distinct and free from the cuticle of the pileus.</p>

<p>This genus contains some of the most deadly poisonous mushrooms, although
a few are known to be very good. There is a large number of species&mdash;about 75
being known, 42 of which have been found in this country&mdash;a few being quite
common in this state. All the Amanita are terrestrial plants, mostly solitary in
their habits, and chiefly found in the woods, or in well wooded grounds.</p>

<p>In the button stage it resembles a small egg or puff-ball, as will be seen
in Figure 6, page 11, and great care should be taken to distinguish it from the
latter, if one is hunting puff-balls to eat; yet the danger is not great, since the
volva usually breaks before the plant comes through the ground.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Phalloides</i> means phallus-like. This plant and its related species are deadly
poisonous. For this reason the plant should be carefully studied and thoroughly
known by every mushroom hunter. In different localities, and sometimes in the
same locality, the plant will appear in very different shades of color. There are
also variations in the way in which the volva is ruptured, as well as in the character
of the stem.</p>

<p>The beginner will imagine he has a new species often, till he becomes
thoroughly acquainted with all the idiosyncrasies of this plant.</p>

<p>The pileus is smooth, even, viscid when young and moist, frequently adorned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
with a few fragments of the volva, white, grayish white, sometimes smoky-brown;
whether the pileus be white, oyster-color or smoky-brown, the center of the cap
will be several shades darker than the margin. The plant changes from a knob
or egg-shape when
young, to almost flat
when fully expanded.
Many plants have a
marked umbo on the
top of the cap and
the rim of the cap
may be slightly turned
up.</p>

<p>The gills are always
white, wide, ventricose,
rounded next to
the stem, and free
from it.</p>

<p>The stem is smooth,
white unless in cases
where the cap is dark,
then the stem of those
plants are apt to be of
the same color, tapering
upward as in the
specimen (Fig. 11);
stuffed, then hollow,
inclined to discolor
when handled.</p>

<p>The volva of this
species is quite variable
and more or less
buried in the ground,
where careful observation
will reveal it.</p>

<p>One need never confound
this species with
the meadow mushroom,
for the spores
of that are always
purple-brown, while a
spore-print of this will
always reveal white
spores. I have seen a slight tint of pink in the gills of the A. phalloides but the
spores were always white. Until one knows thoroughly both Lepiota naucina
and A. phalloides before eating the former he should always hunt carefully for
the remains of a volva and a bulbous base in the soil.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>This plant is quite conspicuous and inviting in all of its various shades of
color. It is found in woods, and along the margin of woods, and sometimes on
lawns. It is from four to eight inches high and the pileus from three to five
inches broad. There is a personality about the plant that renders it readily
recognizable after it has once been learned. Found from August to October.</p>


<h3><i>Amanita recutita. Fr.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Fresh-skinned Amanita. Poisonous.</span></p>

<p>Recutita, having a fresh or new skin. Pileus convex, then expanded, dry,
smooth, often covered with small scales, fragments of the volva; margin almost
even, gray or brownish.</p>

<p>The gills forming lines down the stem.</p>

<p>The stem stuffed, then hollow, attenuated upward, silky, white, ring distant,
edge of volva not free, frequently obliterated.</p>

<p>Rather common where there is much pine woods. August to October.</p>

<p>This species differs from A. porphyria in ring not being brown or brownish.</p>


<h3><i>Amanita virosa. Fr.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Poisonous Amanita.</span></p>

<p>Virosa, full of poison. The pileus is from four to five inches broad; the
entire plant white, conical, then expanded; viscid when moist; margin often
somewhat lobed, even.</p>

<p>The gills are free, crowded.</p>

<p>The stem is frequently six inches long, stuffed, round, with a bulbous base,
attenuated upward, squamulose, ring near apex, volva large, lax.</p>

<p>The spores are subglobose, 8&ndash;10Âµ. This is probably simply a form of A.
phalloides. It is found in damp woods. August to October.</p>

  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 13.</span>&mdash;Amanita muscaria.&mdash;<i>Linn.</i> Cap reddish or orange, showing
scales on the cap and at base of stem.</p>
</div>

<p>Muscaria, from musca, a fly. The fly Amanita is a very conspicuous and
handsome plant. It is so called because infusions of it are used to kill flies. I have
frequently seen dead flies on the fully developed caps, where they had sipped of
the dew upon the cap, and, like the <ins title="Acceptable alternate spelling">Lotos-eaters</ins> of old, had forgotten to move
away. It is a very abundant plant in the woods of Columbiana county, this state.
It is also found frequently in many localities about Chillicothe. It is often a
very handsome and attractive plant, because of the bright colors of the cap in
contrast with the white stem and gills, as well as the white scales on the surface
of the cap. These scales seem to behave somewhat differently from those of
other species of Amanita. Instead of shrivelling, curling, and falling off they are
inclined to adhere firmly to the smooth skin of the pileus, turning brownish, and
in the maturely expanded plant appear like scattered drops of mud which have
dried upon the pileus, as you will observe in Figure 13.</p>

<p>The pileus is three to five inches broad, globose at first, then dumb-bell in
shape, convex, then expanded, nearly flat in age; margin in matured plants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
slightly striate; the
surface of the cap
is covered with
white floccose
scales, fragments
of the volva, these
scales being easily
removed so that old
plants are frequently
comparatively
smooth. The color
of the young plant
is normally red,
then orange to pale
yellow; late in the
season, or in old
plants, it fades to
almost white. The
flesh is white, sometimes
stained yellow
close to the
cuticle.</p>

<p>The gills are pure
white, very symmetrical,
various in
length, the shorter
ones terminating
under the cap very
abruptly, crowded,
free, but reaching
the stem, decurrent
in the form of lines
somewhat broader
in front, sometimes
a slight tinge of
yellow will be observed
in the gills.</p>

<p>The stem is
white, often yellowish with age, pithy and often hollow, becoming rough and
shaggy, finally scaly, the scales below appearing to merge into the form of an
obscure cup, the stem four to six inches long.</p>

<p>The veil covers the gills of the young plant and later is seen as a collar-like
ring on the stem, soft, lax, deflexed, in old specimens it is often destroyed. The
spores are white and broadly elliptical.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>The history of this plant is as interesting as a novel. Its deadly properties
were known to the Greeks and Romans. The pages of history record its undoing
and its accessory to crime. Pliny says, alluding to this species, "very conveniently
adapted for poisoning." This was undoubtedly the species that Agrippina, the
mother of Nero, used to poison her husband, the Emperor Claudius; and the
same that Nero used in that famous banquet when all his guests, his tribunes and
centurions, and Agrippina herself, fell victims to its poisonous properties.</p>

<p>However, it is said this mushroom is habitually eaten by certain people as
an intoxicant; indeed, it is used in Kamchatka and Asiatic Russia, generally,
where the Amanita drunkard takes the place of the opium fiend and the alcohol
bibber in other countries. By reading Colonel George Kennan in his "Tent-life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
in Siberia," and Cooke's "Seven Sisters of Sleep," you will find a full description
of the toxic employment of this fungus which will far surpass any possible
imagination.</p>

<p>It caused the death of the Czar Alexis of Russia; also Count de Vecchi, with
a number of his friends, in Washington in 1896. He was in search of the Orange
Amanita and found this, and the consequences were serious.</p>

<p>In size, shape, and color of the cap there is similarity, but in other respects
the two are very different. They may be contrasted as follows:</p>

<p>Orange Amanita, edible.&mdash;Cap <i>smooth</i>, gills <i>yellow</i>, stem <i>yellow</i>, wrapper
<i>persistent</i>, <i>membranaceous</i>, <i>white</i>.</p>

<p>Fly Amanita, poisonous.&mdash;Cap <i>warty</i>, gills <i>white</i>, stem <i>white</i>, or slightly <i>yellowish</i>,
wrapper <i>soon breaking</i> into <i>fragments or scales</i>, white or sometimes yellowish
brown.</p>

<p>Found along roadsides, wood margins, and in thin woods. It prefers poor
soil, and is more abundant where poplar and hemlock grow. From June to frost.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>Frostiana, named in honor of Charles C. Frost.</p>

<p>The pileus is convex, expanded, bright orange or yellow, warty, sometimes
smooth, striate on the margin, pileus one to three inches broad.</p>

<p>The gills are free, white, or slightly tinged with yellow.</p>

<p>The stem is white or yellow, stuffed, bearing a slight, sometimes evanescent,
ring, bulbous, at the base, the bulb slightly margined by the volva. The spores
globose, 8&ndash;10Âµ in diameter. <i>Peck.</i></p>

<p>Great care should be taken to distinguish this species from A. cÃ¦sarea because
of its often yellow stem and gills. I found some beautiful specimens on Cemetery
Hill and on Ralston's Run. It is very poisonous and should be carefully avoided,
or rather, it should be thoroughly
known that it may be
avoided. The striations on
the margin of its yellow
tinge might lead one to mistake
it for the Orange Amanita.
It is found in shady
woods and sometimes in
open places where there is
underbrush. June to October.</p>

<p>Verna, pertaining to
spring. This species is considered
by some only a white
variety of Amanita phalloides.
The plant is always a
pure white. It can only be
distinguished from the white
form of the A. phalloides by
its closer sheathing volva
and perhaps a more ovate
pileus when young.</p>


<p>The pileus is at first ovate,
then expanded, somewhat
depressed, viscid when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
moist, even, margin naked,
smooth. The gills are free.</p>

<p>The stem is stuffed, with
advancing age hollow, equal,
floccose, white, ringed, base
bulbous, volva closely embracing
the stem with its free
margin, ring forming a broad
collar, reflexed. The spores
are globose, 8Âµ broad.</p>

<p>This species is very abundant
on the wooded hills in this
section of the state. Its pure
white color makes it an attractive
plant, and it should
be carefully learned. I have
found it before the middle of
June.</p>


<h3><i>Amanita magnivelaris. Pk.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Large Veiled Amanita.

<p>Magnivelaris is from <i>magnus</i>,
large; <i>velum</i>, a veil.</p>

<p>The pileus is convex, often
nearly plane, with even margin,
smooth, slightly viscid when moist, white or yellowish-white.</p>

<p>The gills are free, close, white.</p>

<p>The stem is long, nearly equal, white, smooth, furnished with a large
mebranaceous volva, the bulbous base tapering downward and rooting. The
spores are broadly elliptical.</p>

<p>This species very closely resembles Amanita verna, from which it can be
distinguished by its large, persistent annulus, the elongated downward-tapering
bulb of its stem, and, especially, by its elliptical spores.</p>

<p>It is found solitary and in the woods. I found several on Ralston's Run
under beech trees. Found from July to October.</p>


<h3><i>Amanita pellucidula. Ban.</i></h3>

<p>Pileus at first campanulate, then expanded, slightly viscid, fleshy in center,
attenuated at the margin; color a smooth bright red, deeper at the top, shaded

<p>The gills are ventricose, free, numerous, yellow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>The stem is stuffed, ring descending, fugacious. Peck's 44th Report.</p>

<p>This species differs from Amanita cÃ¦sarea in having an even margin and a
white stem. It is only a form of the cÃ¦sarea. The white stem will attract the
attention of the collector.</p>

<p>Solitary, growing alone. I have found this plant in various parts of the
state and have always found them growing alone. In Poke Hollow, where I
found the specimens in the illustrations, I found several on the hillside on
different occasions, but
I have never found them
growing in groups. It is
quite large in size, white
or whitish, very woolly
or floccose. Usually the
cap, stem, and the gills
are covered with a floccose
substance which will
serve to identify the
species. This fluffy exterior
adheres readily to
your hands or clothing.
The cap is sometimes
tinged with brown, but
the flesh is white and
smells quite strong, not
unlike chloride of lime.
The annulus is frequently
torn from the stem
and is found adhering to
the margin of the cap.</p>

<p>The pileus is from
three to five inches broad,
or more, when fully expanded,
at first globose
to hemispherical, as will
be seen in Figures 17 and
18, convex, or plane, warty, white or whitish, the pointed scales being easily rubbed
off, or washed off by heavy rains, these scales varying in size from small granules
to quite large conical flakes, and differing in condition and color in different plants.</p>

<p>The gills are free, or are not attached by the upper part, the edges are
frequently floccose where they are torn from the slight connection with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 30]<br />[Pg 31]</a></span>
upper surface of the veil;
white, or slightly tinged
with cream-color, broad.</p>

<p>The stem is four to
eight inches high, solid,
becoming stuffed when old,
bulbous, rooting deep in
the soil, very scaly, ventricose
sometimes in young
plants, white, very mealy.
Volva friable. Ring, large,
lacerated, usually hanging
to the margin of the cap,
but in Figure 19 it adheres
to the stem.</p>

<p>This is a large and beautiful
plant in the woods, and
easily identified because of
its floccose nature and the
large bulb at the base of
the stem. It is not so warty
and the odor is not nearly
so strong as the Amanita
strobiliformis. It is edible
but very great caution
should be used to be sure of
your species. Found from
July to October in woods
and roadsides.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>Radicata means furnished with a root. The root of the specimen in Figure
20 was broken off in getting it out of the ground.</p>

<p>The pileus is subglobose, becoming convex, dry, verrucose, white, margin
even, flesh firm, white, odor resembling that of chloride of lime.</p>

<p>The gills are close, free, white.</p>

<p>The stem is solid, deeply radicating, swollen at the base or bulbous,
floccose or mealy at the top, white; veil thin, floccose, or mealy, white, soon
lacerated and attached in fragments to the margin of the pileus or evanescent.
The spores are broadly elliptic, 7.5&ndash;10Âµ long, 6&ndash;7Âµ broad. <i>Peck.</i></p>

<p>This is quite a large and beautiful plant, very closely related to Amanita
strobiliformis, but readily distinguished from it because of its white color, its
clearly radiating stem, and small spores. The stem shows to be bulbous and the
cap covered with warts. I found the plant frequently in Poke Hollow and on

<p>The pileus is six to eight inches broad, when young, subglobose, then convex,
expanded, nearly plane, with persistent warts, white, ash-color, sometimes yellow
on the cap, the margin even and extending beyond the gills; warts hard, angular,
pointed, white; flesh white, compact.</p>

<p>The gills are free, crowded, rounded, white, becoming yellow.</p>

<p>The stem is five to eight inches long, frequently longer, tapering upward,
floccosely scaly, bulbous, rooting beyond the bulb; ring large, torn; volva forming
concentric rings. The spores are 13&ndash;14Ã—8&ndash;9Âµ.</p>

<p>This is one of the most stately plants in the woods. It is said to be edible, but
the strong pungent odor, like chloride of lime, has deterred me from eating it.
This, however, is said to disappear in cooking. It grows to be very large.
Dr. Kellerman and I found a specimen in Haynes's Hollow whose stem measured
over eleven inches, and cap nine inches. It is found in open woods and wood
margins. Great caution should be used before the plant is eaten to know it
beyond doubt. Found July to October.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

sometimes tinged with yellow.</p>

<p>The gills are close, reaching the stem, and sometimes forming decurrent lines
upon it, floccose crenulate on the edge, the short ones truncate at the inner extremity,
white.</p>

<p>The stem is equal, bulbous, floccose mealy above, stuffed or hollow, white,
the annulus slight, evanescent. Spores broadly elliptic or subglobose, 7.5&ndash;10
long, nearly as broad, usually containing a single large nucleus. <i>Peck</i>, Bull. Tor.
Bot. Club.</p>

<p>The stem is bulbous at the base but the volva is rarely seen upon it although
slight patches are frequently seen on the pileus. The ring is very evanescent and
soon disappears. The specimens I have received from Mrs. Blackford look good
enough to eat and she speaks highly of the edible qualities of this species. So far
as I know this plant is confined to the New England states. Found from September
to November. It grows in low damp ground under trees.</p>

stages of development.</p>
</div>

<p>Cothurnata means buskined; from corthunus, a high shoe or buskin worn by
actors. This species is easily separated from the other Amanitas. I shall give
Prof. Atkinson's description of it in full: "The pileus is fleshy and passes from
nearly globose to hemispherical, convex, expanded, and when specimens are very
old sometimes the margin is elevated. It is usually white, though specimens are
found with a tinge of citron yellow in the center or of tawny yellow in the center
of other specimens. The pileus is viscid, strongly so when moist. It is finely
striate on the margin, and covered with numerous, white, floccose scales from the
upper half of the volva, forming more or less dense patches, which may wash off
in heavy rains.</p>

<p>The gills are rounded next the stem, and quite remote from it. The edge of
the gills is often eroded or frazzly from the torn-out threads with which they
were loosely connected to the upper side of the veil in the young or button stage.
The spores are globose or nearly so, with a large "nucleus" nearly filling the spore.</p>

<p>The stem is cylindrical, even, and expanded below into quite a large oval<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
bulb, the stem just above the bulb being margined by a close-fitting roll of the
volva, and the upper edge of this presenting the appearance of having been sewed
at the top like the rolled edge of a garment or buskin. The surface of the stem
is minutely floccose, scaly or strongly so, and decidedly hollow even from a very
young stage or sometimes when young with loose threads in the cavity.</p>

<p>A. cothurnata resembles in many points A. frostiana and it will afford the
collector a very interesting study to note the points of difference. I found the two
species growing on Cemetery Hill. Figure 26 is from plants collected in Michigan
and photographed by Dr. Fisher. Found in September and October.</p>

  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 27.</span>&mdash;Amanita rubescens. One-third natural size, caps a dingy reddish-brown,
stains reddish when bruised.</p>
</div>

<p>Rubescens is from <i>rubesco</i>, to become red. It is so called because of the
dingy reddish color of the entire plant, and also because when the plant is handled
or bruised it quickly changes to a reddish color. It is often a large bulky plant
and rather uninviting.</p>

<p>The pileus is four to six inches broad, dingy reddish, often becoming
pale flesh color, fleshy, oval to convex, then expanded; sprinkled with small pale
warts, unequal, mealy, scattered, white, easily separating; margin even, faintly
striate, especially in wet weather; flesh soft, white, becoming red when broken.</p>

<p>The gills are white or whitish, free from the stem but reaching it and forming
at times decurrent lines upon it, thin, crowded.</p>

<p>The stem is four or five inches long, nearly cylindrical, solid, though inclined
to be soft within, tapering from the base up, with a bulbous base which often
tapers abruptly below, containing reddish scales, color dull red. It has seldom any
distinct evidence of a volva at the base but abundant evidence on the cap. Ring
large, superior, white, and fragile.</p>

<p>The plant is quite variable in color, sometimes becoming almost white with
a slight reddish or brownish tint. The strong distinguishing character of the
species is the almost entire absence of any remains of the volva at the base of the
stem. By this, and by the dull red hues and the bruised portions quickly changing
to a reddish color, it is easily distinguished from any of the poisonous Amanitas.</p>

<p>According to Cordier it is largely used as an article of food in France.
Stevenson and Cooke speak well of it. I noticed the small Bohemian boys
gathered it about Salem, Ohio, not having been in this country more than a week
and not being able to speak a word of English. It convinced me that it was an
article of diet in Bohemia and that our species is similar to theirs. I have found
the plants in woods about Bowling Green and Sidney, Ohio. The plants in Figure
27 were collected on Johnson's Island, Sandusky, Ohio, and photographed by Dr.
Kellerman. It is found from June to September.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rough Amanita.</span></p>

<p>Aspera means rough. The pileus is convex, then plane; warts minute, somewhat
crowded, nearly persistent; margin even, rather thin, increasing in thickness
toward the stem; scarcely umbonate, reddish with various tints of livid and gray;
flesh rather solid, white, with tints of reddish-brown immediately next to the
epidermis.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>The gills are free, with sometimes a little tooth behind, running down the
stem, white, broad in front.</p>

<p>The stem is white, squamulose, bulb rugulose, ring superior and entire. The
spores are 8Ã—6Âµ.</p>

<p>When the flesh is bruised or eaten by insects it assumes a reddish-brown color,
and in this respect it resembles A. rubescens. The odor is strong but the taste
is not unpleasant. In woods from June till October. The collector should be
sure he knows the plant before he eats it.</p>

</div>

<p>The Orange Amanita is a large, attractive, and beautiful plant. I have
marked it edible, but no one should eat it unless he is thoroughly acquainted with
all the species of the genus Amanita, and then with great caution. It is said to
have been CÃ¦sar's favorite mushroom. The pileus is smooth, hemispherical, bell-shaped,
convex, and when fully expanded nearly flat, the center somewhat elevated
and the margin slightly curved downward; red or orange, fading to yellow on the
margin; usually the larger and well-developed specimens have the deeper and richer
color, the color being always more marked in the center of the pileus; margin distinctly
striate; gills rounded at the stem end and not attached to the stem, yellow,
free and straight. The color of the gills of matured plants usually is an index
to the color of the spores but it is an exception in this case as the spores are
white.</p>

<p>The stem and the flabby membranaceous collar that surrounds it toward the
top are yellow like the gills, the depth of the color varying more with the size
of the plant than is the case with color of the cap. Sometimes in small and
inferior plants the color of both stem and gills is nearly white, and if the volva
is not distinct it is difficult to distinguish it from the fly mushroom, which is very
poisonous. The stem is hollow, with a soft cottony pith in the young plants.</p>

<p>In very young plants the edge of the collar is attached to the margin of the
cap and conceals the gills, but with the upward growth of the stem and the expansion
of the cap the collar separates from the margin and remains attached
to the stem, where it hangs down upon it like a ruffle.</p>

<p>The expanded cap is usually from three to six inches broad, the stem from
four to six inches long and tapering upward.</p>

<p>When in the button stage, the plant is ovate; and the white color of the
volva, which now entirely surrounds the plant, presents an appearance much like
a hen's egg in size, color, and shape. As the parts within develop, the volva
ruptures in its upper part, the stem elongates and carries upward the cap, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
the remains of the
volva surrounds the
base of the stem in the
form of a cup.</p>

<p>When the volva
first breaks at the
apex, it reveals the
point of the cap with
its beautiful red color
and in contrast with
the white volva makes
quite a pretty plant,
but with advancing
age the red or orange
red fades to a yellow.
In drying the specimens
the red often entirely
disappears. In
young, as well as in
old plants, the margin
is often prominently
marked with striations,
as will be seen
in Figures 28 and 29.
The flesh of the plant
is white but more or
less stained with yellow
next to the epidermis
and the gills,
which are of that
color.</p>

<p>The plant grows in
wet weather from July
to October. It grows
in thin woods and
seems to prefer pine
woods and sandy soil.
I have found it from the south tier of counties to the north of our state. It is not,
however, a common plant in Ohio.</p>

<p>From its several names&mdash;CÃ¦sar's Agaric, Imperial Mushroom, Cibus Deorum,
Kaiserling&mdash;one would infer that for ages it had been held in high esteem as an
esculent.</p>

<p>Too great caution cannot be used in distinguishing it from the very poisonous
fly mushroom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>Amanita spreta. Pk.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hated Amanita. Poisonous.</span></p>

<p>Spreta, hated. The pileus at first is nearly ovate, slightly umbonate, then
convex, smooth, sometimes fragments of the volva adhering, the margin striate,
whitish or pale-brown toward and on the umbo, soft, dry, more or less furrowed
on the margin.</p>

<p>The flesh is white, thin on the edges, and increasing in thickness toward the
center. Gills close, white, reaching the stem.</p>

<p>The stem is equal, smooth, annulate, stuffed or hollow, whitish, finely striate
at the top from the decurrent lines of the gills, not bulbous at the base, the volva
rather large and inclined to yellowish color. The spores are elliptical.</p>

<p>The plant resembles the dark forms of the Amanitopsis in having the marked
striations and the entire and closely fitting volva at the base, but can be easily
distinguished by its ring. I found it on Cemetery Hill in company with the
Amanitopsis. It does not seem to root as deep in the ground as the Amanitopsis.
It is very poisonous and should be carefully studied so that it may be readily
recognized and avoided.</p>

<p>It is found in open woods from July to September.</p>


<h3><i>Amanitopsis. Roze.</i></h3>

<p>Amanitopsis is from <i>Aminita</i> and <i>opsis</i>, resembling; so called because it
resembles the Amanita. The principal feature wherein the genus differs from the
Amanita is the absence of a collar on the stem. Its species are included among the
Amanita by many authors. The spores are white. The gills are free from the
stem, and it has a universal veil at first completely enveloping the young plant,
which soon breaks it, carrying remnants of it on the pileus, where they appear as
scattered warts. It differs from the Lepiota in having a volva.</p>

</div>

<p>Vaginata&mdash;from <i>vagina</i>, a sheath. The plant is edible but should be used with
very great caution. It is quite variable in color, ranging from white to mouse
color, brownish or yellowish.</p>

<p>The pileus is ovate at first, bell-shaped, then convex and expanded, thin, quite
fragile, smooth, when young with a few fragments of the volva adhering to its
surface, deeply and distinctly striate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>The gills are free, white,
then pallid, ventricose, broadest
in front, irregular. The
flesh is white, but in the
darker forms stained under
the easily separating skin.
The spores are white and
nearly round, 7&ndash;10Âµ.</p>

<p>The stem is cylindrical, even
or slightly tapering upward,
hollow or stuffed, smooth or
sprinkled with downy scales,
not bulbous at the base.</p>

<p>The volva is long, thin,
fragile, forming a permanent
sheath which is quite soft and
readily adheres to the base of
the stem.</p>

<p>The striations on the margin
are deep and distinct, as in the
Orange Amanita. The cup is
quite regular but it is fragile,
easily broken and usually deep
in the ground. In some plants
a slight umbo is developed at
the center.</p>

<p>The mushroom-eater wants
to distinguish very carefully
between this species and Amanita spreta, which is very poisonous.</p>

<p>It is found in woods, in open places where there is much vegetable mould,
sometimes found in stubble and pastures, especially in meadows under trees.
Found from June to November.</p>

<p>The plant varies considerably in color, and there are several varieties, separable
by means of their color:</p>

<p>A. vaginata, var. alba. The whole plant is white.</p>

<p>A. vaginata var. fulva. The cap tawny yellow or pale ochraceous.</p>

<p>A. vaginata var. livida. The cap leaden brown; gills and stem tinged with
smoky brown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Gray Amanitopsis. Edible.</span></p>

<p>Strangulata means choked, from the stuffed stem. The pileus is two to four
inches broad, soon plane, livid-bay or gray, with patches of the volva, margin
striate or grooved.</p>

<p>The gills are free, white, close.</p>

<p>The stem is stuffed, silky above, scaly below, slightly tapering upwards. The
volva soon breaking up, forming several ring-like ridges on the stem. The spores
are globose, 10&ndash;13Âµ.</p>

<p>This is a synonym for A. ceciliae. B. and Br. and perhaps nothing more than
a vigorous growth of Amanitopsis vaginata. It has almost no odor and a sweet
taste and cooks deliciously.</p>

<p>Found in the woods and in open places from August to October.</p>


<h3><i>Lepiota. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Lepiota means a scale. In the Lepiota the gills are typically free from the
stem, as in Amanita and Amanitopsis, but they differ in having no superficial or
removable warts on the cap, and no sheathing or scaly remains of a volva at the
base of the stem. In some species the epidermis of the cap breaks into scales which
persistently adhere to the cap, and this feature, indeed, suggests the name of the
genus, which is derived from the Latin word <i>lepis</i>, a scale.</p>

<p>The stem is hollow or stuffed, its flesh being distinct from the pileus and easily
separable from it. There are a number of edible species.</p>

<p>Procera means tall.</p>

<p>The pileus is thin, strongly umbonate, adorned with brown spot-like scales.</p>

<p>The gills are white, sometimes yellowish-white, free, remote from the stem,
broad and crowded, ventricose, edge sometimes brownish.</p>

<p>The stem is very long, cylindrical, hollow or stuffed, even, very long in proportion
to its thickness and is, therefore, suggestive of the specific name, procera.
The ring is rather thick and firm, though in mature plants it becomes loosened and
movable on the stem. This and the form of the plant suggest the name, parasol.
The cap is from three to five inches broad and the stem from five to nine inches
high. I found one specimen among fallen timber that was eleven inches tall and
whose cap was six inches broad.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>It has a wide distribution. It is found in all parts of Ohio but is not abundant
anywhere. It is a favorite with those who have eaten it, and, indeed, it is a
delicious morsel when quickly broiled over coals, seasoned to taste with salt and
pepper, butter melted in the gills and served on toast. This mushroom is especially
free from grubs and it can be dried for winter use.</p>

<p>There is no poisonous species with which one is likely to confound it. The
very tall, slender stem with a bulbous base, the very peculiar spotted cap with the
prominent dark colored umbo and the movable ring on the stem, are ear-marks
sufficient to identify this species.</p>

<p>Spores white and elliptical, 14Ã—10Âµ. Lloyd. It is found in pastures, stubble,
and among fallen timber. July to October.</p>

base, attenuated upward, clothed with fibres pure white. The Smooth Lepiota
is generally very regular in shape and of a pure white color. The central part
of the cap is sometimes tinged with yellow or a smoky white hue. Its surface
is nearly always very smooth and even. The gills are somewhat narrower toward
the stem than they are in the middle. They are rounded and not attached to the
stem.</p>

<p>Cap two to four inches broad; stem two to three inches long. It grows in
clean grassy places in lawn, pastures, and along roadsides. I have seen the roadside
white with this species around Sidney, Ohio. The specimens represented
in figure were found in Chillicothe, August to November.</p>

<p>This is one of the best mushrooms, not inferior to the meadow mushroom.
It has this advantage over the former that the gills retain their white color and
do not pass from a pink to a repulsive black. The halftone and the description
ought to make the plant known to the most casual reader.</p>

<p>This plant is quite common about Chillicothe, especially upon sawdust piles.
It grows both singly and in clusters. The umbonate cap is adorned with reddish
or reddish-brown scales except on the center where the color is uniformly reddish
or reddish-brown because the surface is not broken up into scales; gills close,
free, white, ventricose; stem smooth, enlarged at the base. In some plants the
base of the stem is abnormally large; ring white, inclined to be delicate.</p>

<p>Wounds and bruises are apt to assume brownish-red hues. Dr. Herbst says:
"This is truly an American plant, not being found in any other country. This is
the pride of the family. There is nothing more beautiful than a cluster of this
fungi. To look over the beautiful scaly pileus is a sight equally as fascinating as
a covey of quail."</p>

<p>Found in grassy lawns and on old sawdust piles, in common with Pluteus
cervinus. It is found almost all over the state. It is quite equal to the Parasol
mushroom in flavor. It has a tendency to turn the milk or cream in which it is
cooked to a reddish color. It is found from June to October. Mr. Lloyd suggests
the name Lepiota Bodhami. It is the same as the European plant <ins title="L. h&oelig;matosperma in original">L. hÃ¦matosperma</ins>.

<p>Granosa means covered with granules.</p>

<p>The pileus is convex, obtuse or umbonate, even, radiately rugose-wrinkled,
generally even and regular on the margin, reddish-yellow or light bay.</p>

<p>The gills are attached to the stem, slightly decurrent, somewhat crowded,
whitish, then reddish-yellow.</p>

<p>The stem is thickened at the base, tapering toward the cap, flesh of the stem

<p>It grows on decayed wood. I found it in large quantities, and tried to make
it L. granulosa, but I found it fit better L. amianthinus, which it resembles very
closely, but it is much larger and its habit is not the same. I was not satisfied
with this description and sent the specimens to Prof. Atkinson, who set me right.
It is a beautiful plant found on decayed wood in September and October.</p>

<p>CepÃ¦stipes is from cepa, an onion and stipes, a stem, Pileus is thin at first
ovate, then bell-shaped or expanded, umbonate, soon adorned with numerous
minute brownish scales, which are often granular or mealy, folded into lines on
the margin, white or yellow, the umbo darker.</p>

<p>The gills are thin, close, free, white, becoming dingy with age or drying.</p>

<p>The stem is rather long, tapering toward the apex, generally enlarged in the
middle or near the base, hollow. The ring is thin and subpersistent. The spores
are subelliptical, with a single nucleus, 8&ndash;10Ã—5&ndash;8Âµ.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>The plants often cespitose, two to four inches high. Pileus is one to two
inches broad. It is found in rich ground and decomposing vegetable matter. It
is also found in graperies and conservatories. <i>Peck.</i></p>

<p>This plant derives its specific name from the resemblance of its stem to that
of the seed-stalk of an onion. One form has a yellow or yellowish cap, while the
other has a white or fair cap. It seems to delight to grow in well rotted sawdust
piles and hot houses. The specimens represented in Figure 37 were collected
in Cleveland and photographed by Prof. H. C. Beardslee.</p>

  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 38.</span>&mdash;Lepiota acutesquamosa. Two-thirds natural size, showing small pointed scales.</p>
</div>

<p>Acutesquamosa is from <i>acutus</i>, sharp, and <i>squama</i>, a scale; so called from
the many bristling, erect scales on the pileus. The pileus is two to three inches
broad, fleshy, convex, obtuse, or broadly umbonate; pale rusty with numerous
small pointed scales, which are usually larger and more numerous at the disk.</p>

<p>The gills are free, crowded, simple, white or yellowish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>The stem is two to three inches or more long; stuffed or hollow, tapering
upward slightly from a swollen base; below the ring rough or silky, pruinose
above, ring large. The spores are 7&ndash;8Ã—4Âµ.</p>

<p>They are found in the woods, in gardens, and frequently in greenhouses.
There is a slight difference between the specimens growing in the woods and
those in the greenhouse. In the latter the pubescent covering is less dense and
the erect scales are more numerous than in the former. In older specimens these
scales fall off and leave small scars on the cap where they were attached. The
specimens in Figure 38 were gathered in Michigan and were photographed by
Dr. Fisher of Detroit.</p>


<h3><i>Armillaria. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Armillaria, from armilla, a bracelet&mdash;referring to the ring upon the stem.
This genus differs from all the foregoing white-spored species in having the
gills attached to the stem by their inner extremity. The spores are white and the
stem has a collar, though a somewhat evanescent one, but no wrapper at the base
of the stem as in the Amanita and Amanitopsis. By the collar the genus differs
from the other genera which are to follow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>The Amanita and Lepiota have the flesh of the stem and the pileus not
continuous, and their stems are, therefore, easily separated from the cap, but in
the Armillaria the gills and the pileus are attached to the stem.</p>

<p>Mellea, from melleus, of the color of honey. Cap fleshy, honey colored, or
ochraceous, striate on the margin, shaded with darker brown toward the center,
having a central boss-like elevation and sometimes a central depression in full
grown specimens, tufted with dark-brown fugitive hairs. Color of the cap varies,
depending upon climatic conditions and the character of the habitat. Gills distant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
ending in a decurrent tooth, pallid or dirty white, very often showing brown or
rust colored spots when old. Spores white and abundant. Frequently the ground
under a clump of this species will be white from the fallen spores. Stem elastic
and scaly, four inches or more in length. Ring downy. Diameter of cap from
two to five inches. Manner of growth is frequently in tufts, and, as with most
of the Armillarias, generally parasitic on old stumps.</p>

<p>The veil varies greatly. It may be membranaceous and thin, or quite thick,
or may be wanting entirely, as will be seen in Figure 39; in Figure 40 only a slight
trace of the ring can be seen. The two plants grew under very different environment;
the last grew in the woods and Figure 39 on a lawn in the city. The
species is very common and grows either in thin woods or in cleared lands, on the
ground or on decaying wood. Its favorite habit is about stumps. It is either
solitary, gregarious, or in dense clusters. It is very abundant about Chillicothe,
where I have seen stumps literally surrounded with it. It has a slight acridity
while raw, which it seems to lose in cooking. Those who like it may eat it without
fear, all varieties being edible.</p>

<p>Prof. Peck gives the following varieties:</p>

<ul>
<li>A. mellea var. obscura&mdash;has the cap covered with numerous small black scales.</li>

<li>A. mellea var. flava&mdash;has a cap yellow or reddish-yellow, otherwise normal.</li>

<li>A. mellea var. glabra&mdash;has a smooth cap, otherwise normal.</li>

<li>A. mellea var. radicata&mdash;has a tapering root penetrating the soil.</li>

<li>A. mellea var. bulbosa&mdash;has a bulbous base.</li>

<p>Bulbigera is from <i>bulbus</i>, a bulb, and <i>gero</i>, to bear.</p>

<p>The pileus is fleshy, three to four inches across, convex, then expanded, obtuse,
even, brownish, gray, sometimes reddish, dry, fibrillose near the margin.</p>

<p>The gills are notched at the stem, pallid, crowded at first, at length rather
distant, becoming slightly colored.</p>

<p>The stem is distinctly bulbous, two to three inches long, stuffed, pallid,
fibrillose, ring oblique, fugacious. The spores are 7&ndash;10Ã—5Âµ.</p>

<p>I have found some very fine specimens in Poke Hollow, near Chillicothe. The
stems were short and very bulbous, having hardly any trace of the ring on the
older specimens. The caps were obtusely convex and of a grayish rufescent color.
This species can readily be distinguished by the distinctly marginate bulb at the
base of the stem. The specimens in Figure 41 were found in Poke Hollow, near
Chillicothe, October 2d. I have no doubt of their edibility but I have not eaten
them.</p>

<p>Nardosmia is from <i>nardosmius</i>,
the odor of nardus or spikenard.</p>

<p>The pileus is quite thick, firm
and compact, thinner toward the
margin, strongly involute when
young, grayish white and beautifully
variegated with brown spots,
like the breast of a pheasant,
rather tough, with a separable
epidermis, flesh white.</p>

<p>The gills are crowded, slightly
notched or emarginate, somewhat
ventricose, white.</p>

<p>The stem is solid, short, fibrous,
sheathed by a veil forming a ring
more or less evanescent. The
spores are nearly round, 6Âµ in diameter.</p>

<p>This is the most beautiful species
of the genus, and from its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
pheasant-like spotted cap, as well as its strong odor and taste of spikenard or
almonds, it is easily determined. The almond taste and odor disappears in cooking.
I found some very fine specimens around a pond in Mr. Shriver's woods, east of
Chillicothe. In older specimens the cuticule of the caps frequently breaks into
scales. Found in woods in September and October.</p>


<h3><i>Armillaria appendiculata. Pk.</i></h3>

<p>Appendiculata, bearing small appendages. Pileus is broadly convex, glabrous,
whitish, often tinged with rust-color or brownish rust-color on the disk. Flesh
white or whitish. Gills close, rounded behind, whitish. Stem equal or slightly
tapering upward, solid, bulbous, whitish, the veil either membraneous or webby,
white, commonly adhering in fragments to the margin of the pileus. Spores
subelliptical, 8Ã—5.</p>

<p>Pileus two to four inches broad. Stem 1.5&ndash;3.5 inches long; 5&ndash;10 lines thick.</p>

<p>The general appearance of this species is suggestive of Tricholoma album, but
the appearance of a veil separates it from that fungus and places it in the genus
Armillaria. The veil, however, is often slightly lacerated, or webby, and adherent
to the margin of the pileus. Peck's Report.</p>

<p>I have found this at Salem and Chillicothe.</p>


<h3><i>Tricholoma. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Tricholoma is from two Greek words meaning hair and fringe. This genus
is known by its stout, fleshy stem, without any evidence of a ring, and by the gills
being attached to the stem and having a notch in their edges near or at the extremity.
The veil is absent, or, if present, it is downy and adherent to the margin
of the cap. The cap is generally quite fleshy; the stem is homogeneous and
confluent with the pileus, central and nearly fleshy, without either ring or volva,
and with no distinct bark-like coat. The spores are white or grayish-white.</p>

<p>The distinguishing features are the fleshy stem, continuous with the flesh of
the pileus, and the sinuate or notched gills. This is quite a universal genus. All
the species grow on the ground, so far as I know them.</p>

<p>There are many edible species under this genus, there being only two, so far
as I know, not edible; and no one is likely to touch those on account of their strong
odor. They are T. sulphureum and T. saponaceum.</p>


<h3><i>Tricholoma transmutans. Pk.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Changing Tricholoma. Edible.</span></p>

<p>Transmutans means changing, from changes of color in both stem and gills in
different stages of the plant. This species has a cap two to four inches broad,
viscid or sticky when moist. It is at first tawny-brown, especially with advancing
age. The flesh is white and has a decided farinaceous odor and taste.</p>

<p>The gills are crowded, rather narrow, sometimes branched, becoming reddish-spotted
with age.</p>

<p>The stem is equal or slightly tapering upward; bare, or slightly silky-fibrillose;
stuffed or hollow; whitish, often marked with reddish stains or becoming reddish-brown
toward the base, white within. Spores subglobose, 5Âµ.</p>

<p>The species grows in woods and open places, also in clover pastures, either
singly or in tufts. I have seen large tufts of them, and in that case the caps are
more or less irregular on account of their crowded condition. I found it frequently
about Salem, and this fall, 1905, I found it quite plentiful in a clover pasture near
Chillicothe. Found in wet weather from August to September.</p>

<p>The pileus is three to five inches broad, fleshy, compact, convex, expanded,
obtuse, viscid, scaly, margin incurved at first, pale yellowish, with sometimes a
slight tinge of green in both cap and gills. Flesh white or tinged with yellow.</p>

<p>The gills are free, crowded, rounded behind, yellow.</p>

<p>The stem is stout, solid, pale yellow or white, white within. The spores are
7&ndash;8Ã—5Âµ.</p>

<p>It differs from T. coryphÃ¦um in having gills entirely yellow, while the edges
only of the latter are yellow. It differs from T. sejunctum in the latter having
pure white gills and a more slender stem.</p>

<p>It is found but occasionally here, and then only a specimen or two. It is
an attractive plant and no one would pass it in the woods without admiring it.
Found from August to October.</p>

brownish lilac, then dusky.</p>

<p>The gills are rounded, rather crowded, dingy violet then dusky, notched with
a decurrent tooth.</p>

<p>The stem is colored like the pileus, fibrillose striate, usually slightly curved,
stuffed, short, often thickened at the base.</p>

<p>The spores are 7&ndash;8Ã—3&ndash;4, minutely rugulose.</p>

<p>This species differs from T. nudum in being smaller, tougher, and often
hygrophanous.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>It is found in richly manured gardens, about manure piles, and in hot-houses.

<p>Grammopodium is from two Greek words meaning <i>line</i> and <i>foot</i>.</p>

<p>The pileus is three to six inches broad, flesh thick at the center, thin at the
margin, solid yet tender; brownish, blackish-umber, almost a dingy-lavender when
moist, whitish when dry; at first bell-shaped, then convex, sometimes slightly
wavy, obtusely umbonate; margin at first inclined to be involute, and extending
beyond the gills.</p>

<p>The gills are attached to the stem, broadly notched as will be seen in the
specimen, closely crowded, quite entire, shorter ones numerous, a few branched,
white or whitish.</p>

<p>The stem is three to four inches long, thickened at the base, smooth, firm,
longitudinally grooved from which it gets its specific name, whitish.</p>

<p>The spores are nearly round, 5&ndash;6Âµ.</p>

<p>It closely resembles T. fuligineum but can be distinguished by the grooved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
stem and crowded gills. The specimens in Figure 45 were found near Boston, and
were sent to me by Mrs. Blackford. The plants keep well and are easily dried.
They were found the first of June. They have an excellent flavor.</p>


<h3><i>Tricholoma pÃ¦didum. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Paedidum means nasty, stinking.</p>

<p>The pileus is small, about one and a half inches broad, rather fleshy, tough;
convex, then flattened, soon depressed around the conical umbo; fibrillose, becoming
smooth; smoky gray, somewhat streaked; moist; margin involute, naked.</p>

<p>The gills are adnexed, crowded, narrow, white, then grayish, somewhat sinuate
with a slight decurrent tooth.</p>

<p>The stem is short, slightly striate, dingy gray, thickened at the base. The
spores are elliptical or fusiform, 10&ndash;11Ã—5&ndash;6Âµ.</p>

<p>The specific name, "nasty" or "stinking," has really no application to the plant.
It is said to be very good when cooked. It is found in well manured gardens and
fields, or about manure piles.</p>

<p>It differs from T. sordidum in having no trace of violet color. T. lixivium
differs in the free truncate gills.</p>


<h3><i>Tricholoma lixivium. Fr.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></h3>

<p>Lixivium means made into lye; hence, of the color of ashes and water.</p>

<p>The pileus is two to three inches broad; flesh thin; convex then plane;
umbonate, never depressed; even; smooth; grayish-brown when moist, then umber;
margin membranaceous, at length slightly striate, sometimes wavy.</p>

<p>The gills are rounded behind and adnexed, free, soft, distant, often crisped, gray.</p>

<p>The stem is about two inches long, fibrous, hollow, or stuffed, equal, at first
covered with a white down, fragile, gray.</p>

<p>The spores are elliptical, 7Ã—4&ndash;5Âµ.</p>

<p>The umbonate pileus and the nearly free, broad, gray gills will distinguish it.

<h3><i>Tricholoma quinquepartitum. Fr.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></h3>

<p>Quinquepartitum means divided into five parts. There is no apparent reason
for the name. Fries could not identify LinnÃ¦us' Agaricus quinquepartitus and
he attached the name of this species.</p>

<p>The pileus is three or four inches broad, slightly fleshy; convex, rather
involute, then flattened, somewhat repand; viscid, smooth, even, pale yellowish.</p>

<p>The gills are notched at the point of attachment to the stem, broad, white.</p>

<p>The stem is three to four inches long, solid, striate or grooved, smooth. The
spores are 5&ndash;6Ã—3&ndash;4.</p>

<p>This species differs from T. portentosum in the pileus not being virgate, and
from T. fucatum in the smooth, striate or grooved stem. This plant is found in
thin woods where logs have decayed. I have not eaten this species but I have

<p>This plant is quite widely distributed in the United States. It is found quite
frequently in Ohio and is rather abundant on the hillsides about Chillicothe, where
it is frequently somewhat bulbous. The tinge of brownish-red on the disk, and the
short radiating ridges on the margin of the pileus will serve to identify the plant.
It is edible and fairly good.

</div>

<p>Columbetta is the diminutive
of <i>columba</i>, a dove; so called
from the color of the plant. The
pileus is from one to four inches
broad, fleshy, convex, then expanded;
at first smooth, then
silky; white, center sometimes a
dilute mouse color shading to a
white, frequently a tinge of pink
will be seen on the margin, which
is at first inrolled, tomentose in
young plants, sometimes cracked.</p>

<p>The gills are notched at the
junction of the stem, crowded,
thin, white, brittle.</p>

<p>The stem is two inches or more
long, solid, white, cylindrical, unequal,
often compressed, smooth,
crooked, silky especially in young
plants, bulbous. Spores .00023
by .00018 inch. Flesh white,
taste mild.</p>

<p>This is a beautiful plant, seeming
to be quite free from insects,
and will remain sound for several
days on your study table. I had no end of trouble with it till Dr. Herbst suggested
the species. It is quite plentiful here. Dr. Peck gives quite a number of varieties.
Curtis, McIlvaine, Stevenson, and Cooke all speak of its esculent qualities. Found
in the woods in September and October.</p>

</div>

<p>Melaleucum, black and white; from contrasted colors of the cap and gills.</p>

<p>This Tricholoma grows in abundance in northern Ohio. I have found it
in the woods near Bowling Green, Ohio. The specimens in the halftone were
found near Sandusky, Ohio, and were photographed by Dr. Kellerman. It is
usually found
in sandy soil,
growing singly
in shady
woods.</p>

<p>The pileus
fleshy, thin,
from one to
three inches
broad, convex,
rather
broadly umbonate,
smooth, moist,
with variable
color, usually
pale, nearly
white at first,

few fibrils, usually thickened at the base. The flesh is soft and white. There is
no report, so far as I know, regarding its edibility, and I have no doubt as to this,
but would advise caution.</p>


<h3><i>Tricholoma lascivum. Fr.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Tarry Tricholoma.</span></p>

<p>Lascivum, playful, wanton; so called because of its many affinities, none of
which are very close. The pileus is fleshy, convex, then expanded, slightly obtuse,
somewhat depressed, silky at first, then smooth, even. The gills are notched,
adnexed, crowded, white; the stem is solid, equal, rigid, rooting, white, tomentose
at the base. Found in the woods, Haynes' Hollow near Chillicothe. September
and October.</p>

  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 51.</span>&mdash;Tricholoma Russula. Natural size. Caps reddish or flesh color.</p>
</div>

<p>Russula is so named because of its likeness in color to some species of the
genus Russula.</p>

<p>The pileus is three to four inches broad, fleshy, convex, then depressed, viscid,
even or dotted with granular scales, red or flesh color, the margin somewhat paler,
involute and minutely downy in the young plant.</p>

<p>The gills are rounded or slightly decurrent, rather distant, white, often
becoming red-spotted with age.</p>

<p>The stem is two to three inches long, solid, firm, whitish rosy-red, nearly equal,
scaly at the apex. The spores are elliptical, 10Ã—5Âµ.</p>

<p>This plant is quite variable in many of its peculiar characteristics, yet it usually
has enough to readily distinguish it. The cap may be flesh-color and the stem
rosy-red, the cap may be red and the stem white or whitish with stains of red.
During wet weather the caps of all are viscid; when dry, all may be cracked more
or less. The stems may not be scaly at the apex, often rosy when young. They
are found in the woods solitary, in groups, or frequently in dense clusters. The
specimens in Figure 51 were found in Michigan and photographed by Dr. Fischer.</p>

<p>I found this plant in Poke Hollow. The gills were quite decurrent.</p>


<h3><i>Tricholoma acerbum. Bull.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Bitter Tricholoma.</span></p>

<p>Acerbum means bitter to the taste.</p>

<p>The pileus is three to four inches broad, convex to expanded, obtuse, smooth,
more or less spotted, margin thin, at first involute, rugose, sulcate, viscid, whitish,
often tinged rufous, or yellow, quite bitter to the taste.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>The gills are notched, crowded, pallid or rufescent, narrow.</p>

<p>The stem is solid, rather short, blunt, yellowish, squamulose above or about
the apex. The spores are subglobose, 5&ndash;6Âµ.</p>

<p>These plants were found growing in a thick bed of moss along with Armillaria
nardosmia. They were not perfect plants but I judged them to be T. acerbum
from their taste and involute margin. I sent some to Prof. Atkinson, who confirmed
my classification. They grow in open woods in October and November.</p>


<h3><i>Tricholoma cinerascens. Bull.</i></h3>

<p>Cinerascens means becoming the color of ashes.</p>

<p>The pileus is two to three inches broad, fleshy, convex to expanded, even,
obtuse, smooth, white, then grayish, margin thin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>The gills are emarginate, crowded, rather undulate, dingy, reddish often
yellowish, easily separating from the pileus.</p>

<p>The stem is stuffed, equal, smooth, elastic.</p>

<p>They grow in clusters in mixed wood. They are mild to the taste.</p>

first involute, at length repand.</p>

<p>The gills are rounded behind, rather crowded, thin, white, broad.</p>

<p>The stem is two to four inches long, solid, firm, narrowed upwards, smooth.</p>

<p>This plant is quite plentiful in our woods, growing usually in groups. It
grows upon the leaf mould and is frequently quite large. It is quite acrid to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>

</div>

<p>Imbricatum
means covered
with tiles, <i>imbreces</i>,
referring
to the lacerated
condition of the
cap. This species
is very closely
related to T.
transmutans in
size, color and
taste. It is, however,
easily separated
by its dry
cap and solid
stem. Its cap is
reddish-brown
or cinnamon-brown,
and its
surface often
presents a somewhat
scaly appearance
because
the epidermis
becomes
lacerated or torn
into small irregular
fragments
which adhere
and seem to
overlap like
shingles on a
roof. The flesh
is firm, white,
and has a farinaceous taste as well as odor. The gills are white, becoming red or
rusty spotted, rather close, and notched. The stem is solid, firm, nearly equal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
except slightly swollen at the base, colored much like the cap but usually paler.
When old it is sometimes hollow on account of the insects mining it. The spores
are white and elliptical, .00025 inch long.</p>

<p>I found this mushroom near Salem, Ohio, Bowling Green, Ohio, and on
Ralston's Run near Chillicothe. Found in mixed woods from September to
November.</p>


<h3><i>Tricholoma terriferum. Pk.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Earth-bearing Tricholoma. Edible.</span></p>

<p>Terriferum, earth-bearing, alluding to the viscid cap's holding particles of
loam and pine needles to it as it breaks through the soil. This is a meaty mushroom,
and when properly cleaned makes an appetizing dish.</p>

<p>The pileus is convex, irregular, wavy on the margin and rolled inward,
smooth, viscid, pale yellow, sometimes whitish, generally covered with loam on
account of the sticky surface of the cap, flesh white.</p>

<p>The gills are white, thin, close, slightly adnexed.</p>

<p>The stem is short, fleshy, solid, equal, mealy, very slightly bulbous at the base.</p>

<p>Found near Salem, Ohio, on Hon. J. Thwing Brooks' farm September to
October.</p>


<h3><i>Tricholoma fumidellum. Pk.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Smoky Tricholoma. Edible.</span></p>

<p>Fumidellum&mdash;smoky, because of the clay-colored caps clouded with brown.</p>

<p>The pileus is one to two inches broad, convex, then expanded, subumbonate,
bare, moist, dingy-white or clay-color clouded with brown, the disk or umbo generally
smoky brown.</p>

<p>The gills are crowded, subventricose, whitish.</p>

<p>The stem is one and a half to two and a half inches long, equal, bare, solid
whitish. The spores minute, subglobose, 4&ndash;5Ã—4Âµ. <i>Peck</i>, 44 Rep.</p>

<p>The pileus is one and a half to two inches across, convex, then plane; even,
moist, smooth when the silky veil is gone, water-soaked after a rain; flesh thin,
tough, smell mealy, taste mild and pleasant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>The gills are rounded behind and almost free, crowded, white.</p>

<p>The stem is about two inches long, hollow, solid at the base, smooth, cartilaginous,
tough, rooting. The spores are 9&ndash;10Ã—7&ndash;8Âµ.</p>

<p>It differs from T. album in having the odor of new meal strongly marked.
It is found in open woods during September and October.</p>

<p>The stem is short, cylindrical, whitish. Spores are oblong-elliptical, 5&ndash;6Ã—5Âµ.
Pileus is one inch broad. Stem one to one and a half inches high. <i>Peck</i>, 44th
Rep. N. Y. State Bot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>The caps are quite a bit larger in the specimens found in Ohio than those
described by Dr. Peck. So much so that I was in doubt as to the correct identification.
I sent some specimens to Dr. Peck for his determination. The species
will be readily identified by the fine crowded gills and the smoky blue or blackish
hue they assume when bruised. The caps are frequently wavy, as will be seen
in Figure 54.</p>

<p>I found the plants in Poke Hollow near Chillicothe, September to November.</p>

pointed at the ends, uninucleate, .0003 inch long, .00016 broad. <i>Peck.</i></p>

<p>I found the plant on several occasions in the month of November, but was
unable to fix it satisfactorily until Prof. Morgan helped me out. The specimens
in Figure 59 were found on Thanksgiving day in the Morton woods, in Gallia
County, Ohio. I had found several specimens about Chillicothe, previous to this.</p>

<p>This species seems to be very near T. flavobrunneum, T. graveolens, and T.
Schumacheri, but may be distinguished from them by the spotting of the pileus
when drying and the peculiar shape of the spores.</p>

<p>It is found among the leaves in mixed woods even during freezing weather.

<p>The pileus is four to five inches broad, the stem two to four inches long, and
an inch to an inch and a half thick. <i>Peck</i>, 44th Rep.</p>

<p>This is a very large and showy plant, growing among leaves after heavy
rains. Both this and T. columbetta, as well as a white variety of T. personatum,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
were very plentiful in the same woods. They grow in groups so closely crowded
that the caps are often quite irregular. The darker and scaly disk and larger sized
spore will help you to distinguish it from T. columbetta. The very large specimens
are too coarse to be good. Found in damp woods, among leaves, from August to
November.</p>

<p>Sejunctum means having separated. It refers to the separation of the gills
from the stem. Pileus fleshy, convex, then expanded, umbonate, slightly viscid,
streaked with innate brown or blackish fibrils, whitish or yellow, sometimes greenish-yellow,
flesh white and fragile.</p>

<p>The gills are broad, subdistant, rounded behind or notched, white.</p>

</div>

<p>Personatum means wearing a mask; so called because of the variety of colors
it undergoes. This is a beautiful mushroom, and is excellently flavored; it has
a wide range and is frequently found, in great abundance. I have often seen it
growing in almost a straight line for over twenty feet, the caps so thoroughly
crowded that they had lost their form. When young the cap is convex and quite
firm, with the margin minutely downy or adorned with mealy particles, and incurved.
In the mature plant it is softer, broadly convex, or nearly plane, with
the thin margin spreading and more or less turned upward and wavy. When
young it is pale lilac in color, but with advancing age it changes to a tawny or
rusty hue, especially in the center. Sometimes the cap is white, whitish or gray,
or of a pale violaceous color.</p>

<p>The gills are crowded, rounded next to the stem, and nearly free but approaching
close to the stem, more narrow toward the margin, with a faint tinge of lilac
or violet tint when young, but often white.</p>

<p>The stem is short, solid, adorned with very minute fibers, downy or mealy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
particles when young and fresh, but becoming smooth with advancing age. The
color of the stem is much like the cap but perhaps a shade lighter.</p>

<p>The cap is from one to five inches broad, and the stem from one to three
inches high. It grows singly or in groups. It is found in thin woods and thickets.
It delights to grow where an old saw mill has stood.</p>

<p>The finest specimens
of this species
that I ever saw
grew on a pile of
compost of what
had been green cobs
from the canning
factory. They had
lain in the pile
for about three
years and late in
November the compost
was literally
covered with this
species, many of
whose caps exceeded
five inches while
the color and figuration
of the plants
were quite typical.</p>

<p>In English books
this plant is spoken
of as Blewits and in
France as Blue-stems,
but the stems
in this country are
inclined to be lilac
or violet, and then
only in the younger
plants.</p>

<p>The spores are
nearly elliptical and
dingy white, but in
masses on white
paper they have a salmon tint. Its smooth, almost shining, unbroken
epidermis and its peculiar peach-blossom tint distinguish it from all other species
of the Tricholoma. There is a white variety, very plentiful in our woods, which
is illustrated in Figure 62. They are found only in leaf-mould in the woods.
September to freezing weather.</p>

<h3><i>Tricholoma gambosum. Fr.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">St. George's Mushroom. Edible.</span></p>

<p>Gambosum, with a swelling of the hoof, <i>gamba</i>. The pileus is three to six

involute at first, pale ochre or yellowish white.</p>

<p>The gills are notched, with an adnexed tooth, densely crowded, ventricose,
moist, various lengths, yellowish white.</p>

<p>The stem is short, solid, flocculose at apex, substance creamy white; swollen

<p>The plants grow in pine woods and along the margins of mixed woods,
frequently by roadsides. It is usually found in October and November. The
plants in Figure 63 were found near Waltham, Mass., and were sent to me by
Mrs. E. B. Blackford. This is said to even excel T. personatum in edible qualities.</p>


<h3><i>Clitocybe. Fr.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></h3>

<p>Clitocybe is from two Greek words, a hillside, or declivity, and a head; so
called from the central depression of the pileus.</p>

<p>The genus Clitocybe differs from Tricholoma in the character of the gills.
They are attached to the stem by the whole width and usually are prolonged down
the stem or decurrent. This is the first genus with decurrent gills. The genus
has neither a volva nor a ring and the spores are white. The stem is elastic,
spongy within, frequently hollow and extremely fibrous, continuous with the pileus.</p>

<p>The pileus is generally fleshy, growing thin toward the margin, plane or
depressed or funnel-shaped, and with margin incurved. The universal veil, if
present at all, is seen only on the margin of the pileus like frost or silky dew.</p>

<p>These plants usually grow on the ground and frequently in groups, though
a few may be found on decayed wood.</p>

<p>The Collybia, Mycena, and Omphalia have cartilaginous stems, while the stem
of the Clitocybe is extremely fibrous, and the Tricholoma is distinguished by its
notched gills.</p>

<p>This genus, because of the variations in its species, will always be puzzling
to the beginner, as it is to experts. We may easily decide it is a Clitocybe because
of the gills squarely meeting the stem, or decurrent upon it, and its external fibrous
stem, but to locate the species is quite a different matter.</p>

<p>Media is from <i>medius</i>, middle;
it is so called because it is intermediate
between C. nebularis and
C. clavipes. It is not as plentiful
as either of the others in our
woods.</p>

<p>The pileus is grayish-brown or
blackish-brown, always darker
than C. nebularis. The flesh is
white and farinaceous in taste.</p>

<p>The gills are rather broad, not
crowded, adnate and decurrent,
white, with few transverse ridges
or veins in the spaces between the
gills.</p>

<p>The stem is one to two inches
long, usually tapering upward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 89]<br />[Pg 90]</a></span>
paler than the pileus, rather elastic, smooth. The spores are plainly elliptical,
8Ã—5Âµ.</p>


<p>This resembles very closely the two species mentioned above and is hard to

</div>

<p>Infundibuliformis means funnel-shaped. This is a beautiful plant and very
abundant in woods after a heavy rain. It grows upon the leaves and especially
among pine needles.</p>

<p>The pileus is at first convex and umbonate and as the plant advances in age
the margin becomes elevated until the plant becomes funnel-shaped. The margin
is frequently incurved and finally wavy. The flesh is soft and white. The color
of the cap is a pale tan. If the cap is examined carefully it will be seen to be
covered with a slight down or silky substance, especially on the margin. The
color of the cap is apt to fade so that specimens will be found almost white.</p>

<p>The gills are thin, close, white or whitish, and very decurrent.</p>

<p>The stem is quite smooth, and generally tapers upward from the base. It is
sometimes white or whitish, but more frequently like the cap. Mycelium will usually
be found at the base on the leaves, forming a soft white down. I have found this
species in several parts of the state. It is frequently found in clusters, when the
caps will be irregular on account of the crowded condition. They are very tender
and of excellent flavor.
Found from August to
October.</p>

convex, then expanded, plane, often depressed, sometimes inclined to be wavy;
even, smooth, olive-green.</p>

<p>The gills are adnate, rather close, sometimes slightly decurrent, broad, pallid.</p>

<p>The stem is one to one and a half inches long, often slightly bulbous at the
base.</p>

<p>These plants are found from August to October, in the woods, on leaves.
They are quite common about Chillicothe after a rain. When cooked by themselves
the flavor is a bit strong, but when mixed with other plants not so strong
in flavor, they are fine.</p>

<p>Illudens means deceiving. Pileus of a beautiful yellow, very showy and
inviting. Many a basketful has been brought to me to be identified with the hope
of their edibility. The cap is convex, umbonate, spreading, depressed, smooth,
often irregular from its crowded condition of growth; in older and larger plants
the margin of the pileus is wavy. The flesh is thick at the center but thinner
toward the margin. In old plants the color is brownish.</p>

<p>The gills are decurrent, some much further than others; yellow; not crowded;
broad.</p>

<p>The stem is solid, long, firm, smooth tapering towards the base, as will be
seen by Figure 67, sometimes the stems are very large.</p>

<p>The pileus is from four to six inches broad. The stem is six to eight inches
high. It occurs in large clusters and the rich saffron color of the entire plant
compels our admiration and we are reminded that "not all is gold that glitters."
It will be interesting to gather a large cluster to show its phosphorescence and
the heat which the plant will generate. You can show the phosphorescence
by putting it in a dark room and by placing a thermometer in the cluster you
can show the heat. It is frequently called "Jack-o'-lantern."</p>

<p>I have known people to eat it without harm, but the chances are that it will
make most persons sick. It ought to be good, since it is so abundant and looks
so rich. Found from July to October.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>Multiceps means many heads; so called because many caps are found in one
cluster. It is a very common plant around Chillicothe. It has been found within
the city limits. It is quite a typical species, too, having all the characteristics of
the genus. I have often seen over fifty caps in one cluster.</p>

<p>The pileus is white or gray, brownish-gray or buff; smooth, thin at the margin,
convex, slightly moist in rainy weather.</p>

<p>The gills are white, crowded, narrow at each end, decurrent.</p>

<p>The stem is tough, elastic, fleshy, solid, tinged with the same color as the cap.</p>

<p>The pileus is one to three inches broad; grows in dense tufts. Spores are
white, smooth and globose.</p>

<p>When found in June the plants are a shade whiter than in the fall. The fall
plants are very much the oyster color. The early plant is a more tender one and
better for table use, however, I do not regard it as excellent. They are found in
woods, in old pastures by logs and stumps, and in lawns. June to October.</p>

</div>

<p>Ochropurpurea is from <i>ochra</i>, ocher or clay color; <i>purpureus</i>, purple; it is so
called because the caps are clay-color and the gills are purple. The caps are
convex, fleshy, quite compact, clay-colored, sometimes tinged with purple around
the margin, cuticle easily separating, margin involute, often at first tomentose,
old forms often repand or wavy.</p>

<p>The gills are purple, sometimes whitish in old specimens from the white
spores, broad behind, decurrent, distant.</p>

<p>The stem is paler than the cap, often tinted with purple, solid, frequently
long and swollen in the middle, fibrous. The spores white or pale yellow.</p>

<p>The first time I found this species I never dreamed that it was a Clitocybe.
It was especially abundant on our wooded clay banks or hillsides, near Chillicothe,
during the wet weather in July and August of 1905. It is a hardy plant and
will keep for days. Insects do not seem to work in it readily. When cooked
carefully it is rather tender and fairly good.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>Clitocybe subditopoda. Pk.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></h3>

<p>Subditopoda is so called because it is nearly (sub) like Fries' C. ditopus, which
means living in two places, perhaps referring to the stem being sometimes central
and sometimes eccentric.</p>

<p>The pileus is thin, convex or nearly plane, umbilicate, hygrophanous, grayish-brown,
striate on the margin when moist, paler when dry, flesh concolorous, odor
and taste farinaceous.</p>

<p>The gills are broad, close, adnate, whitish or pale cinereous.</p>

<p>The stem is equal, smooth, hollow, colored like the pileus. The spores are
elliptical, .0002 to .00025 inch long, .00012 to .00016 broad. <i>Peck.</i></p>

<p>It is found on mossy ground in woods. I have found them under pine trees
on Cemetery Hill. Dr. Peck says he separated this species from C. ditopoda
because of the "striate margin of the pileus, paler gills, longer stem, and elliptical
spores." The plant is edible. September and October.</p>


<h3><i>Clitocybe ditopoda. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Ditopoda is from two Greek words, <i>di-totos</i>, living in two places, and <i>pus</i>
or <i>poda</i>, foot, having reference to the stem being central at times and again
eccentric.</p>

<p>The pileus is rather fleshy, convex, then plane, depressed, even, smooth,
hygrophanous.</p>

<p>The gills are adnate, crowded, thin, dark, cinereous.</p>

<p>The stem is hollow, equal, almost naked.</p>

<p>This species resembles in appearance C. metachroa but can be separated by
the mild taste and farinaceous odor. Its favorite habit is on pine needles. August
and September. I found this species in various places about Chillicothe and on
Thanksgiving day I found it in a mixed wood in Gallia County, Ohio, along with
Hygrophorus laurÃ¦ and Tricholoma maculatescens. I sent some specimens to
Dr. Herbst, who pronounced it C. ditopoda.</p>

<p>Pithyophila means pine-loving. This plant is very abundant under pine
trees on Cemetery Hill. They grow on the bed of pine needles. The pileus is
very variable in size, white, one to two inches broad; fleshy, thin, becoming
plane, umbonate, smooth, growing pale, at length irregularly shaped, repand,
wavy, sometimes slightly striate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>The stem is hollow, terete, then compressed, smooth, equal, even, downy
at the base.</p>

<p>The gills are adnate, somewhat decurrent, crowded, plane, always white. The
spores are 6&ndash;7Ã—4Âµ. The plants in Figure 73 are small, having been found during
the cold weather in November. They are said to be good, but I have not eaten
them.</p>


<h3><i>Clitocybe candicans. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Candicans, whitish or shining white. Pileus is one inch broad, entirely
white, somewhat fleshy, convex, then plane, or depressed, even, shining, with
regularly deflexed margin.</p>

<p>The gills are adnate, crowded, thin, at length decurrent, narrow.</p>

<p>The stem is nearly hollow, even, waxy, shining, nearly equal, cartilaginous,
smooth, incurved at the base. The spores are broadly elliptical, or subglobose,
5&ndash;6Ã—4Âµ. Found in damp woods on leaves.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Beaker-Shaped Clitocybe. Edible.</span></p>

<p>Obbata means shaped like an obba or beaker.</p>

<p>The pileus is somewhat membranaceous, umbilicate, then rather deeply
depressed, smooth, inclined to be hygrophanous, sooty-brown, margin at length
striate.</p>

<p>The gills are decurrent, distant, grayish-white, pruinose.</p>

<p>The stem is hollow, grayish-brown, smooth, equal, rather tough.</p>

<p>I found plants growing on Cemetery Hill under pine trees. I had some
trouble to identify the species until Prof. Atkinson helped me out. August to
September.</p>


<h3><i>Clitocybe gilva. Pers.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Yellow Clitocybe. Edible.</span></p>

<p>Gilva means pale yellow or reddish yellow.</p>

<p>The pileus is two to four inches broad, fleshy, compact, soon depressed and
wavy, smooth, moist, dingy ocher, flesh same color, sometimes spotted, margin
involute.</p>

<p>The gills are decurrent, closely crowded, thin, sometimes branched, narrow
but broader in the middle, ochraceous yellow.</p>

<p>The stem is two to three inches long, solid, smooth, nearly equal, somewhat
paler than the cap, and inclined to be villous at the base.</p>

<p>The spores are nearly globose, 4&ndash;5Âµ.</p>

<p>This plant is sometimes found in mixed woods, but it seems to prefer pine
trees. It has a wide distribution, found in the east and south as well as the west.
I have found it in several localities in Ohio. Found from July to September.</p>

<p>The pileus is two to three inches broad, rather fleshy, thin, limp, umbilicate,
then funnel-shaped, even, smooth, sometimes cracking into minute scales, tawny or
rust-colored, margin broadly reflexed.</p>

<p>The gills are strongly decurrent, yellowish, to whitish, close, arcuate.</p>

<p>The stem is tufted, unequal, rusty, somewhat wavy, tough, naked, villous at
the base. The spores are globose or nearly so, 4&ndash;5Ã—3&ndash;4Âµ.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>This resembles the C. infundibuliformis very closely, both in its appearance
and its habit. It grows among leaves in mixed woods during wet weather. It
is gregarious, often many stems growing from one mass of mycelium. The plants
in Figure 74 were collected in Ackerman's woods near Columbus, Ohio, and were
photographed by Dr. Kellerman. They are found on all the hillsides about
Chillicothe. Found from July to late in October.</p>

</div>

<p>Monadelpha is from <i>monos</i>, one and <i>adelphos</i>, brother.</p>

<p>Prof. Morgan of Preston, Ohio, gives the following description of the One-Brotherhood
Clitocybe in the Mycological Flora of the Miama Valley: "Densely
cespitose. Pileus fleshy, convex, then depressed, at first glabrous, then scaly,
honey-colored, varying to pallid-brown or reddish. The stem elongated, solid,
crooked, twisted, fibrous, tapering at the base, pallid-brownish or flesh color.
Spores white, a little irregular, .0055MM."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>It might be easily taken for the ringless Armillaria mellea, but the decidedly
decurrent gills and the solid stem ought to set any one right. In very wet
weather it soon becomes water-soaked, and is then not good. It is found in
woods about stumps, and in newly cleared fields about roots or stumps. From
spring to October. See Plate XII, Figure 75, for an illustration. Bresadola of
Europe has determined this to be the same as that described by Scoparius in 1772
as Agaricus (Clitocybe) tabescens. I have preferred to retain the name given
by Prof. Morgan.</p>


<h3><i>Clitocybe dealbata. Sow.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The White Clytocybe. Edible.</span></p>

<p>Dealbata means whitewashed; so called from its white color.</p>

<p>The pileus is about one inch broad, rather fleshy, convex, then plane, upturned
and wavy, smooth, shining, even.</p>

<p>The gills are crowded, white, attached to the stem.</p>

<p>The stem is fibrous, thin, equal, stuffed. Spores are 4&ndash;5Ã—2.5Âµ.</p>

<p>This is a beautiful plant and widely distributed. Found among leaves and
sometimes in the grass. It makes a delicious dish.</p>


<h3><i>Clitocybe phyllophila. Fr.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Leaf-Loving Clitocybe. Edible.</span></p>

<p>Phyllophila means leaf and fond of. It is so called because it is found on
leaves in the woods during wet weather.</p>

<p>The pileus is one and a half to three inches in diameter, whitish-tan, rather
fleshy, convex, then plane, at length depressed, even, dry, noticeably white around
the margin.</p>

<p>The gills are attached to the stem, decurrent especially after the cap is
depressed, somewhat distant, rather broad, white, becoming yellowish or ocher
tinged, thin.</p>

<p>The stem is two to three inches long, stuffed, becoming hollow, silky, rather
tough, whitish. The spores are elliptical., 6Ã—4Âµ.</p>

<p>The whitish-tan cap with its white, silvery zone near the margin will serve
to identify the species. August to October.</p>


<h3><i>Clitocybe cyathiformis. Bull.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Cup-Shaped Clitocybe. Edible.</span></p>

<p>Cyathiformis is from <i>cyathus</i>, a drinking cup; <i>formis</i>, form or shape.</p>

<p>The pileus is two to three inches broad, fleshy, rather thin; at first depressed,
then funnel-shaped; even, smooth, moist, hygrophanous; the margin involute,
sooty or dark brown when moist, becoming pale when dry, often dingy ochraceous
or tan-color, inclined to be wavy.</p>

<p>The gills are attached to the stem, decurrent from the depressed form of the
pileus, united behind, somewhat dingy, sparingly branched.</p>

<p>The stem is stuffed, elastic, tapering upward, fibrillose, base villous. The
spores are elliptical, 9Ã—6Âµ.</p>

<p>This plant has a wide distribution and is found in woods or wood margins. I
found some very fine specimens on Ralston's Run, near Chillicothe. September
to October.</p>

<p>Laccata means
made of shellac or
sealing-wax. This
is a very common,
variable plant.
Sometimes of a
bright amethyst but
usually of a reddish
brown. The pileus
is from one to two
inches broad, almost
membranaceous,
convex, then
plane, depressed in
the center, downy
with short hairs,
violet or reddish-brown.</p>

<p>The gills are
broad, distant, attached
to the stem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
by the entire width; pale fleshy-red in hue which is more constant than the color
of the cap and which forms an ear-mark to tell the species; adnate with a decurrent
tooth, plane, the white spores being very abundant.</p>

<p>The stem is tough, fibrous, stuffed, crooked, white-villous at the base, rather
long and slender, dull reddish yellow or reddish-flesh-colored, sometimes
pallid or dull ochraceous, slightly striate; when the season is wet it is often
watery.</p>

<p>This waxy Clitocybe has a wide range and is frequently very abundant. It
is found through almost the entire season. It will grow almost anywhere, in
woods, pastures, and lawns, and sometimes on naked ground. The plants in
Figure 76 were found in tall grass in a grove in August. Those in Figure 77
were found the last of November on Cemetery Hill, under pine trees.</p>

<li>Var. pallidifolia&mdash;gills much paler than usual.</li>

<li>Var. striatula&mdash;cap smooth, thin, so that shadowy lines are seen on cap, radiating
from near the center to the margin. This grows in damp places. Some
authors make Clitocybe laccata a type for a new genus and call it Lacaria
laccata.

<h3><i>Collybia. Fr.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></h3>

<p>Collybia is from a Greek word meaning a small coin or a small round cake.
The ring and volva are both wanting in this genus. The pileus is fleshy, generally
thin, and when the plant is young the margin of the pileus is incurved.</p>

<p>The gills are adnate or nearly free, soft, membranaceous. Many species of
Collybia will revive to some extent when moistened, but they are not
coriaceous.</p>

<p>The stem differs in substance from the pileus, cartilaginous or has a cartilaginous
cuticle, while the inside is stuffed or hollow. This is quite a large genus, containing
fifty-four American species.</p>

  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Plate XIII. Figure 78.&mdash;Collybia radicata.</span></p>
</div>

<p>This, in its season, is one of the most common mushrooms in the woods. It
grows in the ground, frequently around old stumps, sometimes on lawns.</p>

<p>Those in Figure 78 were found in the woods on the ground. One plant, as
will be seen by the square, is a foot high.</p>

<p>It is easily recognized by its long root and flat cap. The root extends into
the ground and will frequently break before pulling up. This root gives name
to the species.</p>

<p>The pileus is fleshy, rather thin, convex, then plane, often with margin upturned
in old plants as in Figure 78, and frequently wrinkled at and toward the
umbo, smooth, viscid when moist.</p>

<p>The color is quite variable, from almost white to gray, grayish-brown; flesh
thin, very white, elastic.</p>

<p>The gills are usually snow white, broad, rather distant, broad in the middle,
joined to the stem by the upper angle, unequal.</p>

<p>The stem is frequently long, of the same color as the cap, yet sometimes
paler; smooth, firm, sometimes grooved, often twisted, tapering upward, ending in
a long tapering root, deeply planted in the soil.</p>

<p>The spores are elliptical, 15Ã—10Âµ.</p>

<p>They grow singly, but generally have many neighbors. They are found in
open woods and around old stumps. I seldom have any trouble in getting enough
for a large family and some for my neighbor, who may not know what to get
but does know how to appreciate them. Found from June to October and from
the New England states through the middle west. They differ from C. hariolarum
in the densely tufted habit of the latter.</p>


<h3><i>Colybia ingrata. Schum.</i></h3>

<p>Ingrata means unpleasant; from its somewhat unpleasant odor.</p>

<p>The pileus is one to two inches broad, globose, bell-shaped, then convex,
umbonate, even, brownish-tan.</p>

<p>The gills are free, narrow, crowded, pallid.</p>

<p>The stem is twisted, subcompressed, sprinkled with a mealy tomentum above,
umber below, hollow, rather long, unequal.</p>

<p>I found this plant quite abundant on Cemetery Hill, growing under pine
trees, from the mass of pine needles. Found in July and August.</p>

<p>Platyphylla is from two Greek words meaning broad and leaf, referring to
the broad gills. It is a much larger and stouter plant than Collybia radicata. It
is found in new ground on open pastures about stumps, also in woods, on
rotten logs and about stumps.</p>

<p>The pileus is three to
four inches broad, at first
convex, then expanded,
plane, margin often upturned,
smoky brown to
grayish, streaked with
dark fibrils, watery when
moist, flesh white.</p>

<p>The gills are adnexed,
very broad, obliquely
notched behind, distant,
soft, white, in age more
or less broken or
cracked.</p>

<p>The stem is short, thick,
often striated, whitish,
soft, stuffed, sometimes
slightly powdered at the
apex, root blunt. The
spores are white and
elliptical.</p>

<p>It is easily distinguished
from C. radicata by the
blunt base of the root and
the very broad gills. Like
C. radicata they need to
be cooked well or there
is a slightly bitter taste
to them. They are found
from June to October.</p>

bay red, or tan color, one or two inches broad, convex, plane, sometimes
depressed and the margin elevated, flesh thin and white.</p>

<p>The gills are free with a decurrent tooth, crowded, narrow, white, or whitish,
rarely yellow.</p>

<p>The stem is cartilaginous, smooth, hollow, yellow, or yellowish, equal, sometimes
thickened at the base as will be seen in Figure 80. The color of the stem
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 111]<br />[Pg 112]</a></span>is usually the same as the cap. This is a very common plant about Chillicothe.
They are found in woods, especially under oak trees, but are also found in open
places. I found them on the High School lawn in Chillicothe. Some very fine
specimens that were found growing in a well marked ring, in an old orchard, were
brought to me about the first of May. Their season is from the first of May to
October.</p>

<p>Zonata, zoned; referring to the concentric zones on the cap which show
faintly in Figure 81.</p>

<p>The pileus is about one inch broad, sometimes more, sometimes less; rather
fleshy, thin, convex, when expanded nearly plane, slightly umbilicate, covered
with fibrous down; tawny or ochraceous tawny, sometimes marked with faintly
darker zones; even in the very young specimens the umbilicate condition is usually
present.</p>

<p>The gills are narrow, close, free, white or nearly white, usually with a pulverulent
edge.</p>

<p>The stem is one to three inches long, rather firm, equal, hollow, covered like
the cap with a fibrous down, tawny, or brownish tawny. The spores are broadly
elliptical, .0002 inch long, .00016 broad.</p>

<p>This species closely resembles C. stipitaria, but is easily distinguished from
it because of its habits of growth, different gills, and shorter spores. It is found
on or near decaying wood in mixed woods. I have found it frequently on Ralston's
Run but always only a few specimens in one place. It does not grow in a
cespitose manner with us. Found in August.</p>

rotted down.</p>

<p>Var. immaculata, Cooke, differs
from the typical form in
not changing color or being
spotted, and in the broader and
serrated gills. This variety delights
in fir woods. September
to November.</p>

<p>The gills are free and in old plants remote from the stem, rather crowded,
narrow, flesh colored, then whitish.</p>

<p>The stem is two to three inches long, hollow, pale red, sprinkled with a
mealy pubescence. The spores are slightly ovate, inclined to be pointed at one
end, 5&ndash;6Ã—3&ndash;4Âµ.</p>

<p>These plants grow among leaves in the woods after warm rains, growing
in tufts, sometimes in rows or lines. They are not as large as C. dryophylla,
the stem is quite different and the plants seem to have the ability to revive like
a Marasmius. They can be dried for winter use.</p>

  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 85.</span>&mdash;Collybia myriadophylla.</p>
</div>

<p>Myriadophylla is from two Greek words, meaning many leaves. It has
reference to its numerous gills.</p>

<p>The pileus is very thin, broadly convex, then
plane or centrally depressed, sometimes umbillicate,
hygrophanous, brown when moist, ochraceous
or tan-color when dry.</p>

<p>The gills are very numerous, narrow, linear,
crowded, rounded behind or slightly adnexed,
brownish-lilac.</p>

<p>The stem is slender, but commonly short, equal,
glabrous, stuffed or hollow, reddish-brown. The
spores are minute, broadly elliptical, .00012 to
.00016-inch long, .0008-inch broad. <i>Peck</i>, 49th
Rep.</p>

<p>I found only a few specimens in Haynes's Hollow.
The caps were about an inch broad and the
stems were an inch and a half long. It will be
easily identified if one has the description of it,
because of its peculiarly colored gills. I found
my plants on a decayed stump in August. In the
dried specimens the gills assume a more brownish-red
hue, as in the next following species.</p>

<p>Collybia colorea. Pk. They sometimes appear
to have a glaucous reflection, probably from the abundance of the spores. The
stem is more or less radicated and often slightly floccose-pruinose toward the
base. The basidia are very short, being only .0006 to .0008-inch long.</p>

  <p class="caption"> <span class="smcap">Figure 86.</span>&mdash;Collybia atratoides. Two-thirds natural size. Caps blackish
to grayish-brown.</p>
</div>

<p>Atratoides means like the species <i>atrata</i>, which means black; so called because
the caps when fresh are quite black. Atratoides has a different habitat
and is not so dark.</p>

<p>The pileus is thin, convex, subumbilicate, glabrous, hygrophanous, blackish-brown
when moist, grayish-brown and shining when dry.</p>

<p>The gills are rather broad, subdistant, adnate, grayish-white, often transversely
veiny above and venosely connected.</p>

<p>The stem is equal, hollow, smooth, grayish-brown with a whitish mycelioid
tomentum at the base. The spores are nearly globose, about .0002-inch broad.
The pileus is six to ten lines broad and the stem is about one inch long. <i>Peck.</i></p>

<p>The plant is gregarious, growing on decayed wood and on mossy sticks
in mixed woods. The margin of the cap is often serrated, as you will
see in Figure 86, yet this does not seem to be a constant characteristic of the
species. It is closely related to C. atrata, but its habitat and the color of its
pileus and gills differ very greatly. I have not eaten it, but have no doubt of
its good qualities.</p>

<p>Found in August and September. Quite common in all our woods.</p>

<p>The plant is cespitose. Pileus one-half inch broad. Stem two to three
inches long. <i>Peck's</i> 49th Report.</p>

<p>This is a beautiful plant when growing in large tufts. The entire plant is
tender and has a delicate flavor. I found the plant figured here on the Frankfort
pike where an old saw mill had formerly stood. It grew abundantly there, along
with Lepiota Americana and Pluteus cervinus.</p>

<p>Found from August to October.</p>

November, yet found throughout the winter months.</p>


<h3><i>Mycena. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Mycena is from a Greek word, meaning a fungus. The plants of this genus
are small and rather fragile.</p>

<p>Pileus more or less membranaceous, generally striate, with the margin almost
straight, and at first pressed to the stem, never involute, expanded, campanulate,
and generally umbonate.</p>

<p>The stem is externally cartilaginous, hollow, not stuffed when young, confluent
with the cap. Gills never decurrent, though some species have a broad
sinus near the stem.</p>

<p>Most species are small and inodorous, but some which have a strong alkaline
odor are probably not good. Some are known to be edible.</p>

<p>A few species exude a colored or watery juice when bruised. The Mycena
resembles the Collybia, but never has the incurved margin of the latter. The
plants are usually smaller, and the caps are more or less conical.</p>

<p>This genus might be mistaken for Omphalia, in which the gills are but
slightly decurrent, but in Omphalia the cap is umbilicate while in Mycena it is
umbonate.</p>

<p>Their being so small makes the determination of species somewhat difficult.
Some have characteristic odors which greatly assist in establishing their identity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

lighter toward the margin, smooth, dry, margin striated nearly to the peak of
the umbo, sometimes slightly depressed.</p>

<p>The gills are adnate with a tooth, connected by veins, whitish, then gray,
often flesh color, rather distant, ventricose, edge sometimes entire, sometimes
serrate.</p>

<p>The stem is rigid, cartilaginous, hollow, tough, straight, polished, smooth,
hairy at the base.</p>

<p>It grows on logs and stumps in the woods. It is very common and sometimes
found in abundance. The plants are frequently densely clustered, the numerous
stems matted together by a soft hairy down at the base. There are many forms
of this plant. Found from September to frost. The plants in Figure 89 were
photographed by Prof. G. D. Smith, Akron, O.</p>


<h3><i>Mycena rugosa. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>HÃ¦matopa is from two Greek words, meaning blood and foot.</p>

<p>The pileus is fleshy, one inch broad, conic, or bell-shaped, somewhat umbonate,
obtuse, whitish to flesh-color, with more or less dull red, even, or slightly striate at
the margin, the margin extending beyond the gills and is toothed.</p>

<p>The gills are attached to the stem, often with a decurrent tooth, whitish.
Spores, 10Ã—6&ndash;7.</p>

<p>The stem is two to four inches long, firm, hollow, sometimes smooth, sometimes
powdered with whitish, soft hairy down, in color the same as the pileus,
yielding a dark red juice which gives name to the species.</p>

<p>The color varies quite a little in these plants, owing to some having more
of the red juice than others. The genus is readily identified by the dull blood-red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
juice, hollow stem, the crenate margin of the cap, and its dense cespitose habits.
It is found on decayed logs in damp places from August to October. The plants in
Figure 90 were found in Haynes' Hollow, September 8. The plant is widely
distributed over the United States. No one will have the slightest difficulty in
recognizing this species after seeing the plants in the figure above.</p>

</div>

<p>Pura means unstained, pure.</p>

<p>The pileus is fleshy, thin, bell-shaped, expanded, obtusely umbonate, finely
striate on the margin, sometimes having margin upturned, violet to rose.</p>

<p>The gills are broad, adnate to sinuate, in older plants sometimes free by
breaking away from the stem, connected by veins, sometimes wavy and crenate
on the edge, the edge of the gills sometimes almost or quite white, violet, rose.</p>

<p>The stem is even, nearly naked, somewhat villous at the base, sometimes
almost white when young, later assuming the color of the cap, hollow, smooth.</p>

<p>The spores are white and oblong, 6&ndash;8Ã—3&ndash;3.5. M. Pelianthina differs from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
this in having dark-edged gills. It differs from M. pseudopura and M. zephira
in having a strong smell. M. ianthina differs in having a conical cap.</p>

<p>This plant is quite widely distributed. Our plants are light-violet in color,
and the color seems constant. I have found it in mixed woods. It is found in
September and October.</p>


<h3><i>Mycena vulgaris. Pers.</i></h3>

<p>Vulgaris means common.</p>

<p>The pileus is small, convex, then depressed, papillate, viscid, brownish-gray,
finely striate on the margin.</p>

<p>The gills are subdecurrent, thin, white; the depressed cap and decurrent gills
make the plant resemble an Omphalia. Spores, 5Ã—2.5Âµ.</p>

<p>The stem is viscid, pale, tough, fibrillose at the base, rooting, becoming
hollow. It differs from M. pelliculosa in not having a separable cuticule and the
fold-like gills.</p>

<p>This plant will be recognized by its smoky or grayish color, umbilicate pileus,
and viscid stem. It is found in woods on leaves and decayed sticks. August and
September.</p>

<p>The stem is two to four inches
long, hollow, tough, rooting, viscid,
yellowish, sometimes gray or even
whitish. The spores are elliptical,
8&ndash;10Ã—4&ndash;5Âµ.</p>

<p>These plants have a wide distri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>bution

clusters and solitary. They resemble in many ways M. alcalina but do not have
the peculiar smell.</p>

<p>The plants in Figure 96 were photographed by Prof. G. D. Smith of
Akron.</p>


<h3><i>Omphalia. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Omphalia is from a Greek word meaning the navel; referring here to the
central depression in the cap.</p>

<p>The pileus from the first is centrally depressed, then funnel-shaped, almost
membranaceous, and watery when moist; margin incurved or straight. Stem
cartilaginous and hollow, often stuffed when young, continuous with the cap but
different in character. Gills decurrent and sometimes branched.</p>

<p>They are generally found on wood, preferring a damp woody situation and a
wet season. It is easily distinguished from Collybia and Mycena by its decurrent
gills. In some of the species of the Mycena where the gills are slightly decurrent,
the pileus is not centrally depressed as it is in corresponding species of Omphalia.
There are a few species of Omphalia whose pileus is not centrally depressed but
whose gills are plainly decurrent.</p>

<p>Campanella means a little bell.</p>

<p>The pileus is membranaceous, convex to extended, centrally depressed, striate,
watery, rusty-yellow in color.</p>

<p>The gills are moderately close, decurrent, bow-shaped, connected by veins,
rigid, firm, yellowish. The spores elliptical, 6&ndash;7Ã—3&ndash;4Âµ.</p>

<p>The stem is hollow, clothed with down, and paler above.</p>

<p>This plant is very common and plentiful in our woods and is widely distributed
in the states. It grows on wood or on ground very heavily charged with decaying
wood. It is found through the summer and fall. It is delicious if you have the
patience to gather them.</p>


<h3><i>Omphalia epichysia. Pers.</i></h3>

<p>The pileus is thin, convex to expanded, depressed in the center, sooty-gray
with a watery appearance, pallid to nearly white when dry.</p>

<p>The gills are slightly decurrent, whitish then gray, somewhat crowded.</p>

<p>The stem is slender, hollow, gray. The spores are elliptical, 8&ndash;10Ã—4&ndash;5Âµ.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>It grows in decayed wood. Its smoky color, funnel-shaped pileus, and gray
short stem will distinguish it. I have some plants sent me from Massachusetts
which seem to be much smaller than our plants.</p>

very small, convex, nearly hemispherical, umbilicate, thin, sulcate,
light-ochre, margin crenate, smooth.</p>

<p>The gills are distant, rather broad, shortly decurrent, whitish.</p>

<p>The stem is curved, hollow, colored like the pileus, slightly bulbous at the
base. The spores are 6Ã—5.</p>

<p>This species is very much like Omphalia oniscus and they can only be distinguished
by their habitats and color. It is found in August and September. It
delights in well rotted wood. I have seen millions in one place.</p>


<h3><i>Omphalia oniscus. Fr.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Bolton's Omphalia. Edible.</span></p>

<p>Oniscus, a name given to a species of codfish by the Greeks, so named because
of their gray color. The pileus is flaccid, irregular, about one inch broad, convex,
plane, or depressed, slightly fleshy, wavy, sometimes lobed, margin striate, dark
cinereous, paler when dry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>The gills are adnate, decurrent, livid or whitish, arranged in groups of four,
somewhat distant.</p>

yellowish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>The stem is stuffed, then hollow, even, tough, pale-tawny. The spores are
7&ndash;8Ã—5&ndash;6Âµ.</p>

<p>The plants are usually hygrophanous, but when dry, floccose or slightly silky.
This is a small plant growing usually on lawns, nearly hidden in the grass. I
found some very fine specimens on Dr. Sulzbacher's lawn on Second Street, Chillicothe.
The plant is, however, widely distributed. I found many specimens on the
3d of November.</p>

<p>The gills are distant, deep golden-yellow, occasionally forked.</p>

<p>The stem is hollow, equal, smooth, shining, egg-yellow.</p>

<p>The spores are elliptical, 8Ã—4Âµ.</p>

<p>This plant, is found quite frequently on decayed branches and logs about
Chillicothe. I have never had the opportunity to test its edibility but I have no
doubt of its being good.</p>

<p>The plants in Figure 100 were found in Haynes' Hollow and were photographed

<h3><i>Marasmius. Fr.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></h3>

<p><i>Marasmius is a Greek participle meaning withered or shriveled</i>; it is so called
because the plant will wither and dry up, but revive with the coming of rain.</p>

<p>The spores are white and subelliptical. The pileus is tough and fleshy or
membranaceous.</p>

<p>The stem is cartilaginous and continuous with the pileus, but of a different
texture. The gills are thick, rather tough and distant, sometimes unequal, variously
attached or free, rarely decurrent, with a sharp entire edge. It is quite a large
genus and many of its species will be of great interest to the student.</p>

<p><i>Oreades, mountain nymphs.</i> Pileus is fleshy, tough and pliable when moist,
brittle when dry, convex, becoming flat, somewhat umbonate, brownish-buff at
first, becoming cream-color; when old it is usually quite wrinkled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>The gills are broad and wide apart, creamy or yellowish, rounded at the stem
end, unequal in length.</p>

<p>The stem is solid, equal, tough, fibrous, naked and smooth at base, everywhere
with a downy surface. The spores are white, 8Ã—5.</p>

<p>To my mind there is no more appetizing mushroom than the "Fairy Ring"
mushroom. Figure 101 will give an accurate notion of the plant and Figure 102
will show how they grow in the grass. It is found in all parts of Ohio. Every
old pasture field or lawn will be full of these rings. The plant is small but its
plentifulness will make up for its size.</p>

<p>There are many conjectures why this and many other mushrooms grow in
a circle. The explanation is quite obvious. The ring is started by a clump or
an individual mushroom. The ground where the mushroom grew is rendered
unfit for mushrooms again, the spores fall upon the ground and the mycelium
spreads out from this point, consequently each year the ring is growing larger.
Sometimes they appear only in a crescent form. One can tell, by looking over
a lawn or pasture, where the rings are, because, from the decay of the mushroom,
the grass is greener and more vigorous there.</p>

<p>Long ago, in England and Ireland, before the peasantry had begun to question
the reality of the existence of the fairy folk and their beneficent interference
in the affairs of life, these emerald-hued rings were firmly believed to be due to
the fairy footsteps which nightly pressed their chosen haunts, and to mark the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
"little people's" favorite dancing ground. "They had always fine music among
themselves, and danced in a moonshiny night around or in a ring, as one may
see to this day upon every common in England where mushrooms grow," quaintly
says one old writer. And the Rev. Gerard Smith still further voices the belief
of the people as to the nature of these grassy rings:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"The nimble elves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That do by moonshine green sour ringlets make,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereof the ewe bites not; whose pastime 'tis<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make these midnight mushrooms."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is a very common plant, and it will pay any one to know it, as we cannot
find anything in the markets that will equal it as a table delicacy.</p>

<h3><i>Marasmius urens. Fr.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Stinging Marasmius.</span></p>

<p>Urens means burning; so called from its acrid taste.</p>

<p>The pileus is pale-buff, tough, fleshy, convex or flat, becoming depressed and
finally wrinkled, smooth, even, one to two inches broad.</p>

<p>The gills are unequal, cream-colored, becoming brownish, much closer than
in the Fairy Ring, hardly reaching the stem proper, joined behind.</p>

<p>The stem is solid above and hollow below, fibrous, pale, its surface more or
less covered with flocculent down, and densely covered with white down at the
base.</p>

<p>It will be well for collectors to pass by this and M. peronatus, or to exercise
the greatest caution in their use. They have been eaten without harm, but they
also have so long been branded as poisonous that too great care cannot be taken.
Its taste is acrid, and it grows in lawns and pastures from June to September.</p>

ones between, sometimes forked, whitish.</p>

<p>The stem is one to two inches long, horny, filiform, hollow, quite smooth,
black, often twisted when dry. The spores are 7Ã—3&ndash;4Âµ.</p>

<p>This is a very attractive little plant found on the leaves in the woods after a

It is quite a common
plant with us, found in damp
woods or around a swampy place.
The pileus with us is convex.
Some authorities speak of an umbilicate
cap. The plant is quite
hardy and easily identified because
of its long and slender stem,

</div>

<p>Rotula means a little wheel.</p>

<p>The pileus is one to three lines broad, hemispherical, umbilicate, and minutely
umbonate, plaited, smooth, membranaceous, margin crenate, white, or pale buff,
with a dark umbilicus.</p>

<p>The gills are broad, distant, few, equal, or occasionally with a few short ones,
of the color of the pileus, attached to a free collar behind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>The stem is setiform, slightly flexuous, white above, then tawny, deep shining
brown at the base, striate, hollow, frequently branched and sarmentose, with or
without abortive pilei.&mdash;M. J. B. This plant is very common in woods on fallen
twigs. The plants in Figure 108 were collected near Cincinnati. This plant has a
wide distribution. It is in all our Ohio woods.</p>

  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 109.</span>&mdash;Marasmius scorodonius.</p>
</div>

<p>Scorodonius is from a Greek word meaning like garlic.</p>

<p>The pileus is one-half inch or more broad, reddish when young, but becoming
pale, whitish; somewhat
fleshy, tough;
even, soon plane,
rugulose even when
young, at length
rugulose and crisped.</p>

<p>The gills are attached
to the stem,
often separating,
connected by veins,
crisped in drying,
whitish.</p>

<p>The stem is at
least one inch long,
hollow, equal, quite
smooth, shining, reddish.
The spores are
elliptical, 6Ã—4Âµ.</p>

<p>It is found in
woods growing on
sticks and decayed
wood. It is strong-smelling.
It is frequently
put with
other plants to give
a flavor of garlic
to the dish. Found
from July to October.</p>


<h3><i>Marasmius calopus. Fr.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></h3>

<p>Calopus is from two Greek words meaning beautiful and foot, so called
because of its beautiful stem.</p>

<p>The pileus is rather fleshy, tough, convex, plane then depressed, even, at
length rugose, whitish.</p>

<p>The gills are emarginate, adnexed, thin, white, in groups of 2&ndash;4.</p>

<p>The stem is hollow, equal, smooth, not rooting, shining, reddish-bay. It is
found growing on twigs and fallen leaves, in the woods. Smaller than M.
Scorodonius but with longer stem.</p>


<h3><i>Marasmius prasiosmus. Fr.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Leek-Scented Marasmius.</span></p>

<p>Prasiosmus means smelling like a leek; from, <i>prason</i>, a leek. The pileus is
one-half to one inch broad, somewhat membranaceous, tough, bell-shaped, pale
yellow or whitish, disk often darker, wrinkled.</p>

<p>The gills are adnexed, somewhat close, white.</p>

<p>The stem is tough, hollow, pallid and smooth above, dilated at the base,
tomentose and brown. It is found in woods adhering to oak leaves after
heavy rains. It is very near M. porreus but differs from it in its gills being
white and caps not being striated. It differs from M. terginus mainly in its
habitat and leek-like scent.</p>


<h3><i>Marasmius anomalus. Pk.</i></h3>

<p>Anomalus, not conforming to rule, irregular. The pileus is one to two inches
broad, somewhat fleshy, tough, convex, even, reddish-gray.</p>

<p>The stem is two to three inches long, hollow, equal, smooth, pallid above,
reddish-brown below.</p>

<p>The gills are rotundate-free, close, narrow, whitish or pallid. <i>Morgan.</i></p>

<p>This is quite a pretty plant, growing on sticks among leaves in the woods.
It is larger than most of the small Marasmii found in similar habitats.</p>


<h3><i>Marasmius semihirtipes. Pk.</i></h3>

<p>Semihirtipes means a slightly hairy foot or stem.</p>

<p>The pileus is thin, tough, nearly plane or depressed, smooth, sometimes striate
on the margin, hygrophanous, reddish-brown when moist, alutaceous when dry,
the disk sometimes darker.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>The gills are subdistant, reaching the stem, slightly venose-connected, sub-crenulate
on the edge, white.</p>

<p>The stem is equal, even or finely striate, hollow, smooth above, velvety-tomentose
toward the base, reddish-brown. <i>Peck.</i></p>

<p>These plants are very small, often no doubt overlooked by the collector. They
are gregarious in their mode of growth.</p>


<h3><i>Marasmius longipes. Pk.</i></h3>

<p>Longipes means long stem or foot.</p>

<p>The pileus is thin, convex, smooth, finely striate on the margin, tawny-red.</p>

<p>The gills are not crowded, attached, white.</p>

<p>The stem is tall, straight, hollow, equal, covered with a downy meal, rooting,
brown or fawn-color, white at the top.</p>

<p>These plants are quite small and slender, sometimes four to five inches high.
They are rather common in our woods after a rain.</p>


<h3><i>Marasmius graminum. Berk.</i></h3>

<p>Graminum is the gen. pl. of <i>gramen</i>, which means grass.</p>

<p>The pileus small, membranaceous, convex, then nearly plane, umbonate, deeply
and distinctly striate or sulcate, tinged with rufous, the furrows paler, disc brown.</p>

<p>The gills are attached to a collar that is free around the stem, few in number,
slightly ventricose, cream-color.</p>

<p>The stem is short, slender, equal, smooth, shining, black, whitish above.</p>

<p>The spores are globose, 3&ndash;4Âµ.</p>

<p>This species is very near M. rotula but it can be easily distinguished by the
pale rufescent, distinctly sulcate pileus, and its growing on grass. I have frequently
found it on the Chillicothe high school lawn.</p>

</div>

<p>This is a very beautiful plant found in the woods after a rain, growing from
the leaves. They are found singly, but usually in groups.</p>

<p>The pileus is at first nearly conical, then campanulate, membranaceous, dry,
smooth, furrows radiating from almost the center, growing larger as they approach
the margin, ochraceous-red, the disk a little darker.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>The gills are free or slightly
attached, few, distant, broad,
narrowed toward the stem, whitish.</p>

<p>The stem is hollow, tough,
smooth, shining, blackish-brown,
two to three inches long. The
pileus is about a half inch broad.</p>

<p>The plant is quite common in
our woods. I have not found it
elsewhere. The plants in the
photograph represent the pink
form, which is not so common as
the ochraceous-red. In the pink
form the center of the cap and
the apex of the stem is a delicate
pink, which gives the plant a beautiful appearance.</p>

<p>Found from June to October. I have not tested it but have no doubt of its
esculent qualities.</p>


<h3><i>Marasmius fagineus. Morgan.</i></h3>

<p>Fagineus means belonging to <ins title="beach in original.">beech.</ins></p>

<p>Pileus a little fleshy, convex then plane or depressed, at length somewhat
repand, rugose-striate, reddish-pallid or alutaceous.</p>

<p>The gills are short-adnate, somewhat crisped, close, pale reddish.</p>

<p>The stem is short, hollow, pubescent, thickened upward, concolorous; the base
somewhat tuberculose. <i>Morgan</i>, Myc. Flora M. V.</p>

<p>This plant is quite frequently found in our woods growing on the bark at the
base of living beech trees. Its habitat, its reddish or alutaceous cap, and its
paler gills will clearly identify the species.</p>


<h3><i>Marasmius peronatus. Fr.</i></h3>

</div>

<p>Peronatus is from <i>pero</i>, a boot.</p>

<p>The pileus is reddish-buff, convex, slightly flattened at the top, quite wrinkled
when old; diameter, at full expansion, between one and two inches, margin
striate.</p>

<p>The gills are thin and crowded, creamy, becoming light reddish-brown, continuing
down the stem by a short curve.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>The stem is fibrous-stuffed, pale, densely clothed at the base with stiff yellowish
hairs.</p>

<p>It grows in the woods, among dead leaves, from May till frost.</p>

<p>It is usually solitary yet is sometimes found in clusters. It has been eaten
frequently without injury, but by most writers is branded poisonous. It is quite
acrid, but that disappears in cooking. The dense yellow hairs at the base of the
stem appear to constitute the distinguishing characteristic. Found from July to
October.</p>


<h3><i>Marasmius ramealis. Fr.</i></h3>

  </a>
  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 113.</span>&mdash;Marasmius ramealis. Natural size.</p>
</div>

<p>Ramealis means a branch or stick; so called because the plant is found growing
on sticks, in open woods.</p>

<p>The pileus is very small, somewhat fleshy, plane or a trifle depressed, obtuse,
not striate, slightly rugulose, opaque.</p>

<p>The gills are attached to the stem, somewhat distant, narrow, white.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>The stem is about one inch long, stuffed, mealy, white, inclined to be rufescent
at the base.</p>

<p>The spores are elliptical, 4Ã—2Âµ.</p>

<p>This is a very pretty plant, but easily overlooked. It is found on oak and
beech branches, frequently in large groups. Figure 113 illustrates their mode of
growth and will assist the collector in identifying the species. Not poisonous, but
too small to gather. Found from July to October. The specimens in Figure 113
were found in Haynes' Hollow near Chillicothe and photographed by Dr.
Kellerman.</p>


<h3><i>Marasmius saccharinus. Batsch.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Granular Marasmius. Edible.</span></p>

<p>Saccharinus is from <i>saccharum</i>, sugar; it is so called because the white pileus
looks very much like loaf sugar.</p>

<p>The pileus is entirely white, membranaceous, convex, somewhat papillate,
smooth, sulcate and plicate.</p>

<p>The gills are broadly and firmly attached to the stem, narrow, thick, very
distant, united by veins, whitish.</p>

<p>The stem is quite thin, thread-form, attenuated upward, at first flocculose, at
length becoming smooth, inserted obliquely, reddish, pale at the apex. Spores,
5Ã—3Âµ.</p>

<p>Quite common in wet weather on dead oak limbs in woods. This plant differs
from M. epiphyllus in its habitat, in the papillate form of its pileus and the stem's
being flocculose, then smooth; also in that the gills are united in a reticulated
manner. Common. July to October.</p>


<h3><i>Marasmius epiphyllus. Fr.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Leaf Marasmius. Edible.</span></p>

<p>Epiphyllus means growing on leaves.</p>

<p>The pileus is white, membranaceous, nearly plane, at length umbilicate,
smooth, wrinkled, plicate.</p>

<p>The gills are firmly attached to the stem, white, connected by veins, entire,
distant, few.</p>

<p>The stem is rather horny, bay, minutely velvety, apex pale, inserted. The
spores are 3Ã—2Âµ. This plant is abundant everywhere, on fallen leaves in woods
during rainy weather. July to October.</p>

<p>Delectans means pleasing
or delightful.</p>

<p>The pileus is subcoriaceous,
convex, then expanded
and depressed, glabrous,
rugulose, white, changing
in drying to pale alutaceous.</p>

<p>The gills are moderately
broad, unequal, rather distant,
trabeculate between,
white, emarginate, adnexed;
the spores are lance-oblong,
hyaline, 7&ndash;9Ã—4Âµ.</p>

<p>The stem, arising from
an abundant white-floccose
mycelium, is long, slender,
tapering slightly upward,
smooth, brown and shining,
white at the apex.</p>

<p>It is found growing on
old leaves in woods. The
plants in the figure were
collected in the woods at
Sugar Grove, Ohio, by R.
A. Young, July 28, 1906,
and photographed by Dr.
Kellerman. Found from
July to October.</p>

then expanded.</p>

<p>The gills are pure white, unequal, some of them forked, adnate, the interstices
venulose.</p>

<p>The stem is thickest at the apex, tapering downward, black, white-pruinose,
the base insititious. <i>Morgan</i>.</p>

<p>It is found on old leaves, sticks, and old acorns and hickory-nuts. When dry,
the stem loses its black color and the gills become flesh-color. It is quite common
in thin and open woods. The spores are hyaline and stellate, 3&ndash;5-rayed. Found
from July to October.</p>

<p>This is called Heliomyces nigripes by some authors.</p>


<h3><i>Pleurotus. Fr.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></h3>

<p>Pleurotus is from two Greek words meaning side and ear, alluding to its
manner of growth on a log. This genus is very common everywhere in Ohio, and
is easily determined by its eccentric, lateral, or even absent stem, but it must
have white spores, and the characteristics of the Agaricini.</p>

<p>Pileus fleshy in the larger species and membranaceous in the smaller forms,
but never becoming woody. Stem mostly lateral or wanting; when present,
continuous with cap. Gills with sinus or broadly decurrent, toothed.</p>

<p>Grows in woods.</p>

<p>Gills broad, decurrent, subdistant, branching at the base, white or whitish.
The stem when present is very short, firm, lateral, sometimes rough with stiff
hair, hairy at the base. Spores oblong, white, .0003 to .0004 inch long, .00016 inch
broad.</p>

<p>This is one of our most abundant mushrooms, and the easiest for the beginner
to identify. In Figures 116 and 117, you will see the plant growing in imbricated
form apparently without any stem. In Figure 118 is a variety that has a pronounced
stem, showing how the stems grow together at the base, the slight
grooving on the stems, also the decurrent gills. In most of these plants the
stems are plainly lateral, but a few will appear to be central. It will be difficult
to distinguish it from the Sapid mushroom and for table purposes there is little
need to separate them. In Ohio the Oyster mushroom is very common everywhere.
I have seen trees sixty to seventy feet high simply loaded with this
mushroom. If one will locate a few logs or stumps upon which the Oyster
mushroom grows, he can find there an abundant supply (when conditions are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
right for fungus growth) during the entire season. It is almost universally a
favorite among mushroom eaters, but it must be carefully and thoroughly cooked.
It grows very large and frequently in great masses. I have often found specimens
whose caps were eight to ten inches broad. It is found from May to
December.</p>

<p>Salignus, from <i>salix</i>, a willow. Pileus is compact, nearly halved, horizontal,
at first cushion-shaped, even, then with the disk depressed, substrigose, white or
fuliginous. The stem, eccentric or lateral, sometimes obsolete, short, white-tomentose.
The gills are decurrent, somewhat branched, eroded, distinct at the
base, nearly of the same color. Spores .00036 by .00015 inch. Fries.</p>

<p>I found this species near Bowling Green on willow stumps. About every
ten days the stumps offered me a very excellent dish, better than any meat market
could afford. September to November.</p>

</div>

<p>Ulmarius, from <i>ulmus</i>, an elm. It takes its name from its habit of growing on
elm trees and logs. It appears in the fall and may be found in company with
the Oyster mushroom, late in December, frozen solid. This species is frequently
seen on elm trees, both dead and alive, on live trees where they have been trimmed
or injured in some way. It is often seen on elms in the cities, where the elm
is a common shade tree. Its cap is large, thick and firm, smooth and broadly
convex, sometimes pale yellow or buff. Frequently the epidermis in the center of
the cap cracks, giving the surface a tessellated appearance as in Figure 119. The
flesh is very white and quite compact. The gills are white or often becoming tawny
at maturity, broad, rounded or notched, not closely placed, sometimes nearly
decurrent. The stem is firm and solid, various in length, occasionally very short,
inclined to be thick at the base and curved so that the plant will be upright, as
will be seen in Figure 119.</p>

<p>The cap is from three to six inches broad. A specimen that measured over
ten inches across the cap, was found some thirty feet high in a tree. While it
was very large, it was quite tender and made several meals for two families.
But this species is not limited entirely to the elm. I found it on hickory, about
Chillicothe. There are a few elm logs along my rambles that afford me fine
specimens with great regularity. Insects do not seem to infest it as they do the
ostreatus and the sapidus. Sometimes, when the plant grows from the top of a
log or the cut surface of a stump, the stem will be longer, straight, and in the
center of the cap. This form is called by some authors var. verticalis.</p>

<p>For my own use I think the Elm mushroom, when properly prepared, very
delicious. Like all tree mushrooms it should be eaten when young. It is easily
dried and kept for winter use. Found from September to November.</p>

<p>This species is so called from its likeness to the petals of a flower. Pileus
fleshy, spathulate, entire; margin at first involute, finally fully expanded; villous,
depressed. The stem is compressed and villous, often channelled, nearly erect.
The gills are strongly decurrent, crowded, narrow, and white or whitish.
Spores minutely globose, .0003 by .00015.</p>

<p>The plant varies very greatly in form and size. Its chief characteristic is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
the presence of numerous short white cystidia in the hymenium, which dot the
surface of the hymenium, and under an ordinary pocket lens give to the gills a
sort of fuzzy appearance. Frequently it will have the appearance of growing
from the ground, but a careful examination will reveal a piece of wood of some
kind, which serves as a host for the mycelium. I have found this plant but a few
times, It seems to be quite rare in our state, especially in the southern part of the
state. The plants in Figure 120 were photographed by Prof. G. D. Smith of
Akron, Ohio.</p>

</div>

<p>Sapidus, savory. This
plant grows in clusters
whose stems are more or less
united at the base as in
Figure 121. The caps when
densely crowded are often irregular.
They are smooth
and vary much in color, being
whitish, ash-gray, brownish,
yellowish-gray.</p>

<p>The flesh is thick and
white. The gills are white
or whitish, rather broad,
running down on the stem,
and slightly connected, at
times, by oblique or transverse
branches. The stem is generally short, solid, several usually springing
from a thickened base, white or whitish and either laterally or eccentrically
connected with the cap.</p>

<p>This plant is classed with
the white-spored species,
yet its spores, after a short
exposure to the air, really
exhibit a pale lilac tint.
This can only be seen when
the spores are in sufficient
quantity and resting on a
suitable surface.</p>

<p>The size of the plant
varies, the cap being commonly
from two to five
inches long. It grows in
woods and open places, on
stumps and logs of various
kinds. Its edible quality is
quite as good as the Oyster
mushroom. The only way
by which it can be distinguished
from the P. ostreatus
is by its lilac-tinted
spores. It is found from
June to November.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>Serotinoides, like serotinus, which means late-coming; from its appearing in
the winter.</p>

<p>The pileus is fleshy, one to three inches broad, compact, convex or nearly
plane, viscid when young and moist, half-kidney-shaped, roundish, solitary or
crowded and imbricated, variously colored, dingy-yellow, reddish-brown, greenish-brown
or olivaceous, the
margin at first involute.</p>

<p>The gills are close, determinate,
whitish or yellowish.</p>

<p>The stem is very short,
lateral, thick, yellowish beneath,
and minutely downy
or scaly with blackish
points.</p>

<p>The spores are minute,
elliptical, .0002 inch long,
.0001 inch broad.</p>

<p>There is probably no difference
between this and P.
serotinus, the European
species. It is a beautiful
plant. The color and size
are quite variable. I found
it on Ralston's Run and in
Baird's woods on Frankfort
Pike. It is found from September
to January.</p>


<h3><i>Pleurotus applicatus. Batsch.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Little Gray Pleurotus.</span></p>

  </a>
  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 125.</span>&mdash;Pleurotus applicatus. Natural size.</p>
</div>

<p>Applicatus means lying upon or close to; so named from the sessile pileus.
The pileus is one-third of an inch across, when young cup-shaped, dark cinereous,
somewhat membranaceous, quite firm, resupinate, then reflexed, somewhat striate,
slightly pruinose, villous at the base.</p>

<p>The gills are thick, broad in proportion to the size of the cap, distant, radiating,
gray, the margin lighter, sometimes the gills are as dark as the pileus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes it is attached only by the center of the pileus; sometimes, growing
on the side of a shelving log, it is attached laterally. It is not as abundant as
some other forms of Pleurotus. It differs from P. tremulus in absence of a distinct
stem.</p>


<h3><i>Pleurotus cyphellÃ¦formis. Berk.</i></h3>

<p>CyphellÃ¦formis means shaped like the hollows of the ears. The pileus is cup-shaped,
pendulous, downy or mealy, upper layer gelatinous, gray, very minutely
hairy, especially at the base, margin paler.</p>

<p>The gills are narrow, rather distant, pure white, alternate ones being shorter.
These are very small plants, found only in damp places on dead herbaceous plants.
They resemble a Cyphella griseo-pallida in habit.</p>


<h3><i>Pleurotus abscondens. Pk.</i></h3>

<div class="fcenter">
 <a name="image126" id="image126"></a>

  </a>
  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 126.</span>&mdash;Pleurotus abscondens. Entire plant white.</p>
</div>

<p>Abscondens means keeping out of view. It is so called because it persists in
growing in places where it is hidden from sight.</p>

<p>The pileus is often two and a half inches broad, delicate-white, strong stringent
odor, usually pruinose, margin slightly incurved.</p>

<p>The gills are attached to the stem, rather crowded, very white, somewhat
narrow.</p>

<p>The stem is short, solid, pruinose, usually lateral, and curved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>The plant usually grows in hollow stumps or logs, and in this case the stem
is always lateral and the plant grows very much as does the P. ostreatus, except
that they are not imbricated. Occasionally the plant is found on the bottom of a
hollow log and in that case the cap is central and considerably depressed in the
center. I have never seen it growing except in a hollow stump or log. Its manner
of growth and its delicate shape of white will serve to identify it. It is found
from August to November.</p>


<h3><i>Pleurotus circinatus. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Circinatus means to make round, referring to the shape of the pileus.</p>

<p>The pileus is two to three inches broad, white, plane, orbicular, convex at first,
even, covered over with silky-pruinose lustre.</p>

<p>The gills are adnate-decurrent, rather crowded, quite broad, white.</p>

<p>The stem is equal, smooth, one to two inches long, stuffed, central or slightly
eccentric, rooted at the base.</p>

<p>The form of these plants is quite constant and the round white caps will at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
first suggest a Collybia. The white gills and its decurrent form will distinguish
it from P. lignatilis. It makes quite a delicious dish when well cooked. I found
some beautiful specimens on a decayed beech log in Poke Hollow. Found in
September and October.</p>


<h3><i>Lactarius. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Lactarius means pertaining to milk. There is one feature of this genus that
should easily mark it, the presence of milky or colored juice which exudes from
a wound or a broken place on a fresh plant. This feature alone is sufficient to
distinguish the genus but there are other points that serve to make the determination
more certain.</p>

<p>The flesh, although it seems quite solid and firm, is very brittle. The fracture
is always even, clean cut, and not ragged as in more fibrous substances.</p>

<p>The plants are fleshy and stout, and in this particular resemble the Clitocybes,
but the brittleness of the flesh, milky juice, and the marking of the cap, will easily
distinguish them.</p>

<p>Many species have a very acrid or peppery flavor. If a person tastes one
when raw, he will not soon forget it. This acridity is usually lost in cooking.</p>

<p>The pileus in all species is fleshy, becoming more or less depressed, margin at
first involute, often marked with concentric zones.</p>

<p>The stem is stout, often hollow when old, confluent with the cap.</p>

<p>The gills are usually unequal, edge acute, decurrent or adnate, milky; in
nearly all the species the milk is white, changing to a sulphur yellow, red, or violet,
on exposure to the air.</p>

</div>

<p>Torminosus, full of grips, causing colic. The pileus is two to four inches
broad, convex, then depressed, smooth, or nearly so, except the involute margin
which is more or less shaggy, somewhat zoned, viscid when young and moist,
yellowish-red or pale ochraceous, tinged with red.</p>

<p>The gills are thin, close, rather narrow, nearly of the same color as the pileus,
but yellower and paler, slightly forked, subdecurrent.</p>

<p>The stem is one to two inches long, paler than the cap, equal or slightly
tapering downward, stuffed or hollow, sometimes spotted, clothed with a very
minute adpressed down.</p>

<p>The milk is white and very acrid. The spores are echinulate, subglobose,
9&ndash;1OÃ—7&ndash;8Âµ.</p>

<p>This differs from L. cilicioides in its zoned pileus and white milk. Most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
authorities speak of it as dangerous. Captain McIlvaine speaks of the Russians as
preserving it in salt and eating it seasoned with oil and vinegar. They grow in the
woods, open places, and in fields. The specimens in Figure 127 were found in
Michigan and photographed by Dr. Fischer.</p>

convex, then expanded, depressed in the center, dry, never viscid, and quite broad.</p>

<p>The gills are creamy-white, narrow, close, unequal, forked, decurrent, adnate,
exuding a milky juice when bruised, milky-white, very acrid.</p>

<p>The stem is creamy white, short, thick, solid, smooth, rounded at the end,
slightly tapering at the base. Spores generally with an apiculus, .0002 by .00024
inch.</p>

<p>The plant is found in all parts of Ohio, but most people are afraid of it on
account of its very peppery taste. Although it can be eaten without harm, it will
never prove a favorite.</p>

<p>It is found in open woods from July to October. In its season is one of the
very common plants in all of our woods.</p>


<h3><i>Lactarius pergamenus. Fr.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></h3>

<p>Pergamenus is from <i>pergamena</i>, parchment. The pileus is convex, then expanded,
plane, depressed, wavy, wrinkled, without zones, often repand, smooth,
white.</p>

<p>The gills are adnate, very narrow, tinged with straw-color, often white,
branched, much crowded, horizontal.</p>

<p>The stem is smooth, stuffed, discolored, not long. The milk is white and
acrid. Spores, 8Ã—6. It differs from L. piperatus in its crowded, narrow gills and
longer stem. Found in woods from August to October.</p>

<p>Deceptivus means deceiving.</p>

<p>The pileus is three to five inches broad, compact, at first convex, and umbilicate,
then expanded and centrally depressed or subinfundibuliform, obsoletely
tomentose or glabrous except on the margin, white or whitish, often varied with

<p>The stem is one to three inches
long, equal or narrowed
downward, solid, pruinose-pubescent,
white. Spores are
white, 9&ndash;12.7Âµ. Milk white,
taste acrid.</p>

<p>This plant delights in woods
and open groves, especially under
coniferous trees. It is a
large, meaty, acrid white
species, with a thick, soft, cottony
tomentum on the margin
of the pileus of the young plant.</p>

<p>The specimen photographed
was sent me from Massachusetts
by Mrs. Blackford. It
grows in July, August and
September. Its sharp acridity
is lost in cooking, but like all
acrid Lactarius it is coarse and
not very good.</p>

<p>This is one of our most striking
plants. No one can fail to recognize
it, because of the deep indigo
blue that pervades the whole plant.
I have found it in only one place,
near what is known as the Lone-Tree
Hill near Chillicothe. I have
found it there on several different
occasions.</p>

<p>The pileus is from three to five
inches broad, the very young plants
seem to be umbilicate with the
margin strongly incurved, then depressed
or funnel-shaped; as the
plant ages the margin is elevated
and sometimes waved. The entire
plant is indigo blue, and the surface<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
of the cap has a silvery-gray appearance
through which the indigo color
is seen. The surface of the cap is
marked with a series of concentric
zones of darker shade, as will be seen
in Figure 130 especially on the
margin; sometimes spotted, becoming
paler and less distinctly zonate with
age or in drying.</p>

<p>The gills are crowded, indigo blue,
becoming yellowish and sometimes
greenish, with age.</p>

<p>The stem is one to two inches long,
short, nearly equal, hollow, often spotted
with blue, colored like the
pileus.</p>

<p>It is edible but rather coarse. Found
in open woods July and August.</p>

  </a>
  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 137.</span>&mdash;Lactarius cinereus.</p>
</div>

<p>Cinereus is from <i>cineres</i>,
ashes; so called from the
color of the plant.</p>

<p>The pileus is one to two
and a half inches broad,
zoneless, somewhat viscid,
floccose-scaly, depressed in
the center, margin thin,
even, flesh thin and white,
mild to the taste, ashy-gray.</p>

<p>The gills are adnate,
rather close, sometimes
forked (usually near the
stem), uneven, white or
creamy-white, milk white,
not plentiful.</p>

<p>The stem is two to three
inches long, tapering upward,
loosely stuffed, finally
hollow, often floccose at
the base.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>This plant is quite common from September to November, growing in damp
weather on leaves in mixed woods. It has a mild taste. While I have not eaten
it I have no doubt of its edibility. The color of the pileus is sometimes quite dark.</p>


<h3><i>Lactarius griseus. Pk.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gray Lactarius.</span></p>

  </a>
  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 138.</span>&mdash;Lactarius griseus.</p>
</div>

<p>Griseus means gray.</p>

<p>The pileus is thin, nearly plane,
broadly umbilicate or centrally depressed,
sometimes infundibuliform,
generally with a small umbo or papilla,
minutely squamulose tomentose,
gray or brownish-gray, becoming
paler with age.</p>

<p>The gills are thin, close, adnate,
or slightly decurrent, whitish or yellowish.</p>

<p>The stem is slender, equal or
slightly tapering upward, rather
fragile; stuffed or hollow; generally villose or tomentose at the base; paler than, or
colored like, the pileus.</p>

<p>The spores are .0003 to .00035 inch; milk white, taste subacrid.
Pileus is 6 to 18 lines broad, stem 1 to 2 inches long, 1 to 3 lines thick. <i>Peck.</i></p>

<p>It resembles L. mammosus and L. cinereus. It differs from the former in
not having ferruginous gills and pubescent stems, and from the latter by its smaller
size, its densely pubescent pileus, and its habitat. It grows on mossy logs or in
mossy swamps. The base of one of the plants in Figure 138 is covered with the
moss in which they grew. These plants were found in Purgatory Swamp, near
Boston, by Mrs. Blackford. They grow from July to September.</p>


<h3><i>Lactarius distans. Pk.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Distant-Gilled Lactarius. Edible.</span></p>

<p>Distans means distant, so called because the gills are very wide apart.</p>

<p>The pileus is firm, broadly convex or nearly plane, umbilicate or slightly
depressed in the center; with a minute, velvety pruinosity; yellowish-tawny or
brownish-orange.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>The gills are rather broad, distant, adnate or slightly decurrent, white or
creamy yellow, interspaces veined; milk white, mild.</p>

<p>The stem is short, equal or tapering downward, solid, pruinose, colored like
the pileus.</p>

<p>The spores are subglobose, 9&ndash;11Âµ broad. <i>Peck</i>, N. Y. Report, 52.</p>

<p>I frequently mistake this plant for L. volemus when seen growing in the
ground, but the widely separated gills distinguish the plant as soon as it is gathered.
The stem is short and round, tapering downward, solid, colored like the pileus.
The milk is both white and mild. I find it on nearly every wooded hillside about
Chillicothe. It is found from July to September.</p>


<h3><i>Lactarius atroviridus. Pk.</i></h3>

  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 139.</span>&mdash;Lactarius atroviridus. Cap and stem dark green. Cap depressed in
center. Gills white.</p>
</div>

<p>Atroviridus is from <i>ater</i>, black; <i>viridus</i>, green; so called from the color of
the cap and the stem of the plant.</p>

<p>The pileus is convex, plane, then depressed in the center, with an adherent
pellicle, greenish with darker scales, margin involute.</p>

<p>The gills are slightly decurrent, whitish, broad, distant; milk white but not
copious as in many of the Lactarii.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>The stem is quite short, tapering downward, dark green, scaly.</p>

<p>The stem is so short that the cap seems to be right on the ground, hence it is
very easily overlooked. It is found only occasionally on mossy hillsides, where
there are not too many leaves. The plant in Figure 139 was found in Haynes'
Hollow, near Chillicothe. I have found the plant on top of Mt. Logan. It is
found from July to October. I do not know of its edibility. All specimens that
I have found I have sent to my Mycological friends. It should be tasted with
caution.</p>


<h3><i>Lactarius subdulcis. Fr.</i></h3>

  </a>
  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 140.</span>&mdash;Lactarius subdulcis.</p>
</div>

<p>Subdulcis means almost sweet, or sweetish.</p>

<p>The pileus is two to three inches broad, rather thin, papillate, convex, then
depressed, smooth, even, zoneless, cinnamon-red or tawny-red, margin sometimes
wavy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>The gills are rather narrow, thin, close, whitish, often reddish or tinged with
red. Spores, 9&ndash;10Âµ.</p>

<p>The stem is stuffed, then hollow, equal, slightly tapering upward, slender,
smooth, sometimes villous at the base. The milk is white, sometimes rather acrid
and unpleasant to the taste when raw. It needs to be cooked a long time to make
it good.</p>

<p>It is likely to be found anywhere, but it does best in damp places. The plants
found with us all seem to have red or cinnamon-red gills, especially before the
spores begin to fall. They are found growing on the ground, among leaves, or on
well-rotted wood and sometimes on the bare ground. Found from July to
November.</p>


<h3><i>Lactarius serifluus. Fr.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></h3>

<p>Serifluus means flowing with serum, the watery part of milk.</p>

<p>The pileus is fleshy, depressed in the center, dry, smooth, not zoned, tawny-brown,
margin thin, incurved.</p>

<p>The gills are crowded, light-brown, or yellowish, milk scanty and watery.</p>

<p>The stem is solid, equal, paler than the pileus. Spores, 7&ndash;8Âµ.</p>

<p>It differs from L. subdulcis in having a solid stem and perhaps a shade darker
color. Found in woods, July to November.</p>


<h3><i>Lactarius corrugis. Pk.</i></h3>

  </a>
  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 141.</span>&mdash;Lactarius corrugis. Caps wrinkled, tawny-brown. Gills orange-brown.</p>
</div>

<p>Corrugis means wrinkled.</p>

<p>The pileus is convex, plane, expanded, slightly depressed in the center;
surface of the cap wrinkled, dry, bay-brown; margin at first involute.</p>

<p>The gills are adnexed, broad, yellowish or brownish-yellow, growing paler
with age. The stem is rather short, equal, solid, pruinose, of the same color as
the pileus. The spores are subglobose, 10&ndash;13Âµ.</p>

<p>This species looks very much like L. volemus, and its only essential difference
is in the wrinkled form, and color of the pileus. The milk when dry is very sticky
and becomes rather black. It has just a touch of acridity.</p>

<p>Any one determining this species will not fail to note the number of brown
cystidia or setÃ¦, in the hymenium, which project above the surface of the gills.
They are so numerous and so near the edge of the gills that they give these a
downy appearance. The quality of this species is even better than L. volemus,
though it is not as abundant here as the latter. Found in thin woods from August
to September. The photograph, Figure 141, was made by Prof. H. C. Beardslee.</p>

<p><i>Volemus from volema pira, a kind of a pear</i>, so called from the shape of the
stem. The pileus is broad, flesh thick, compact, rigid, plane, then expanded, obtuse,
dry, golden-tawny, at length somewhat wrinkly.</p>

<p>The gills are crowded, adnate or slightly decurrent, white, then yellowish;
milk copious, sweet.</p>

<p>The stem is solid, hard, blunt, generally curved like a pear-stem; its color is
that of the pileus but a shade lighter. Spores globose, white.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>The milk in this species is very abundant and rather pleasant to the taste.
It becomes quite sticky as it dries on your hands. This plant has a good record
among mushroom eaters, both in this country and Europe.</p>

<p>There is no danger of mistaking it. The plants grow in damp woods from
July to September. They are found singly or in patches. They were found quite
plentifully about Salem, Ohio, and also about Chillicothe.</p>


<h3><i>Lactarius deliciosus. Fr.</i></h3>

  </a>
  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 143.</span>&mdash;Lactarius deliciosus. One-third natural size.
Caps light reddish-yellow. Milk orange color.</p>
</div>

<p>Deliciosus, delicious. The pileus is three to five inches broad; color varying
from yellow to dull orange or even brownish-yellow with mottled concentric zones
of deeper color, especially in younger plants, sometimes a light reddish-yellow,
without apparent zones (as is the case of those in Figure 143); convex, when
expanded becoming very much depressed; funnel-shaped; smooth, moist, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>times
irregular, wavy; flesh
brittle, creamy, more or less
stained with orange.</p>

<p>The gills are slightly decurrent
in the depressed
specimens, somewhat crowded,
forked at the stem, short
ones beginning at the margin;
when bruised exuding
a copious supply of milky
juice of an orange color; a
pale tan-color, turning green
in age or in drying. Spores
are echinulate, 9&ndash;10Ã—7&ndash;8Âµ.</p>

<p>The stem is two to three
inches or more, equal,
smooth, hollow, slightly pruinose, paler than the cap, occasionally spotted with
orange, tinged with green in old plants.</p>

<p>The taste of the raw plant is slightly peppery. It grows in damp woods and
is sometimes quite common. Its name suggests the estimation in which it is held
by all who have eaten it.
Like all Lactarii it must be
well cooked. The specimens
in Figure 143 were gathered
on Cemetery Hill close
to the pine trees and in
company with Boletus Americanus.
Found from July
to November. I found the
plant in a more typical
form about Salem, Ohio.</p>


<h3><i>Lactarius uvidus. Fr.</i></h3>

  </a>
  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 144.</span>&mdash;Lactarius uvidus.</p>
</div>

<p>Uvidus is from <i>uva</i>,
grape, so called because
when exposed to the air
changes to the color of a
grape.</p>

<p>The pileus is two to four
inches broad, flesh rather
thin, convex, sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
slightly umbonate, then depressed in the center, not zoned, viscid, dingy pale
ochraceous-tan, margin at first involute, naked, milk mild at first then becoming
acrid, white changing to lilac.</p>

<p>The gills are thin, slightly decurrent, crowded, shorter ones very obtuse and
truncate behind, connected by veins, white, when wounded becoming lilac.</p>

<p>The stem is soon hollow, two to three inches long, viscid, pallid.</p>

<p>The spores are round, 10Âµ.</p>

<p>Not only the milk changes to a lilac when cut, but the flesh itself. They are
found in damp woods during August and September. The plants in Figure 144
were found near Boston, by Mrs. Blackford. These plants grew in Purgatory
Swamp. The Sphagnum moss will be seen at the base of the upright plant.</p>


<h3><i>Lactarius chrysorrheus. Fr.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Yellow-Juiced Lactarius.</span></p>

<p>Chrysorrheus from two Greek words; <i>chrysos</i>, yellow or golden; <i>reo</i>, I flow,
because the juice soon turns to a golden yellow.</p>

<p>The pileus is rather fleshy, depressed, then funnel-shaped, yellowish-flesh
colored, marked with dark zones or spots.</p>

<p>The stem is stuffed, then hollow, equal, or tapering below, paler than the
pileus, sometimes pitted.</p>

<p>The gills are decurrent, thin, crowded, yellowish, milk white, then golden-yellow,
very acrid.</p>

<p>The milk is white, quite acrid, has a peculiar taste, and changes at once on
exposure to a beautiful yellow. This is a common species about Salem, Ohio, and
is quite variable in size. Found in woods and groves from July to October. I do
not know whether its edible quality has ever been tested. When I found it some
years ago I had less faith in mushrooms than I have now.</p>


<h3><i>Lactarius vellereus. Fr.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Wooly-White Lactarius. Edible.</span></p>

<p>Vellereus from vellus, a fleece. The pileus is white, compact, fleshy, depressed
or convex, tomentose, zoneless, margin at first involute, milk white and acrid.</p>

<p>The gills are white or whitish, distant, forked, adnate or decurrent, connected
by veins, bow-shaped, milk scanty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>The stem is solid, blunt, pubescent, white, tapering downward. Spores white
and nearly smooth, .00019 by .00034 inch.</p>

<p>This species is quite common; and though very acrid to the taste, this acridity
is entirely lost in cooking. It will be readily known by the downy covering of the
cap. Found in thin woods and wood margins. July to October.</p>


<h3><i>Russula. Pers.</i></h3>

<p>Russula, red or reddish. The beginner will have little difficulty in determining
this genus. There is such a strong family likeness that, finding one, he will say
at once it is a Russula. The contour of the cap, the brittleness of its flesh and of
its stem, the fragile gills, and the failure of any part of the plant to exude a milky
or colored juice, the many gay colors&mdash;will all help in determining the genus.</p>

<p>Many species of Russula strongly resemble those of the genus Lactarius, in
size, shape, and texture. The spores, too, are quite similar, but the absence of the
milky juice will mark the difference at once.</p>

<p>The cap may be red, purple, violet, pink, blue, yellow, or green. The colored
zones often seen in the Lactarii do not appear here. The beginner will possibly
find trouble in identifying species, because of variation of size and color. The
spores are white to very pale yellow, generally spiny. The pileus is fleshy, convex,
then expanded, and at length depressed. The stem is brittle, stout, and smooth,
generally spongy within, and confluent with the cap. The gills are milkless, with
acute edge, and very tender.</p>

<p>Captain McIlvaine, in his very valuable book, One Thousand American Fungi,
says: "To this genus authors have done special injustice; there is not a single
species among them known to be poisonous, and where they are not too strong of
cherry bark and other highly flavored substances, they are all edible; most of them
favorites." I can testify to the fact that many of them are favorites, though a few
are very peppery and it requires some courage to attack them.</p>

<p>They are all found on the ground in open woods, from early summer to late
fall.</p>


<h3><i>Russula delica. Fr.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Weaned Russula. Edible.</span></p>

<p>Delica means weaned, so called because, though it resembles Lactarius vellereus
in appearance, it is void of milk.</p>

<p>The pileus is quite large, fleshy, firm, depressed, even, shining, margin involute,
smooth, not striated.</p>

<p>The gills are decurrent, thin, distant, unequal, white.</p>

<p>The stem is solid, compact, white, short.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>Specimens will be found that resemble Lactarius piperatus and L. vellereus,
but they may be easily distinguished because they have no milk in their gills and
the taste is mild. They are not equal to most of the Russulas. Found in woods
from August to October.</p>


<h3><i>Russula adusta. Pers.</i></h3>

<p>Adusta means burned.</p>

<p>The pileus is fuliginous, cinereous, flesh compact, margin even and inflexed,
depressed in the center.</p>

<p>The gills are attached to the stem, decurrent, thin, crowded, unequal, white,
not reddening when bruised.</p>

<p>The stem is obese, solid, of the same color as the pileus, not turning red when
bruised.</p>

<p>The plant resembles R. nigricans, but can readily be distinguished from it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
because of the thin, crowded gills and failure to turn red when cut or bruised.
The spores are subglobose, almost smooth, 8&ndash;9Âµ; no cystidia. It is found in the
woods during August and September. Edible but not first class. It is a plant
very widely distributed.</p>

<p>Nigricans means blackish.</p>

<p>The pileus is two to four inches broad, dark grayish-brown, black with advancing
age, fleshy, compact, flesh turning red when bruised or convex, flattened,
then depressed, at length funnel-shaped, margin entire, without striate, margin at
first incurved, young specimens are slightly viscid when moist, even, without a
separable pellicle; whitish at first, soon sooty olive, at length becoming broken up
into scales and black; flesh firm and white, becoming reddish when broken.</p>

<p>The gills are rounded behind, slightly adnexed, thick, distant, broad, unequal,
the shorter ones sometimes very scanty, forked, reddening when touched.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>The stem is rather short, thick, solid, equal, pallid when young, then black.
The spores are subglobose, rough, 8&ndash;9Âµ.</p>

<p>The plant is quite compact, inodorous, becoming entirely black with age. It
is easily distinguished from R. adusta by the flesh becoming reddish when bruised,
and by the much thicker, and more distant gills. It is very close to R. densifolia
but differs from it in that its gills are more distant and because of its mild taste.</p>

<p>I am pleased to present to my readers, in Figure 146, a photograph of a plant
which grew in Sweden in the locality where Prof. Fries did his great work in
fungal study and research. It is a typical specimen of this species. It was gathered
and photographed by Mr. C. G. Lloyd.</p>

<p>It is found from June to October. Not poisonous, but not good.</p>

<h3><i>Russula ochrophylla. Pk.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Ochrey Gilled Russula. Edible.</span></p>

<p>Ochrophylla is from two Greek words meaning <i>ochre</i> and <i>leaf</i>, because of

or slightly depressed in the center; even, or rarely very slightly striate on the
margin when old; purple or dark purplish-red; flesh white, purplish under the
adnate cuticle; taste mild.</p>

<p>The gills are entire, a few of them forked at the base, subdistant, adnate at
first yellowish, becoming bright, ochraceous-buff when mature and dusted by the
spores, the interspaces somewhat venose.</p>

<p>The stem is equal or nearly so, solid or spongy within, reddish or rosy tinted,
paler than the pileus. The spores are bright, ochraceous-buff, globose, verruculose,
.0004 of an inch broad. <i>Peck.</i></p>

<p>This is one of the easiest Russulas to determine because of its purple or
purplish-red cap, entire gills, at first yellowish, then a bright, ochraceous-buff when
mature. The taste is mild and the flavor fairly good.</p>

<p>There is also a plant which has a purplish cap and a white stem, called Russula
ochrophylla albipes. Pk. It quite agrees in its edible qualities with the former.</p>

<p>R. ochrophylla is found in the woods, especially under oak trees, in July and
August.</p>

<p>Lepida, from <i>lepidus</i>, neat.</p>

<p>The pileus firm, solid; varying in color from bright red to dull, subdued
purplish with a distinct brown; compact; convex, then depressed, dry unpolished;
margin even, sometimes cracked and scaly, not striated.</p>

<p>The gills are white, broad, principally even, occasionally forked, very brittle,
rounded, somewhat crowded, connected by veins, sometimes red on the edge,
especially near the margin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>The stem is solid,
white, usually stained
and streaked with
pink, compact, even.</p>

<p>The surface is dull,
as with a fine dust
or plum-like bloom,
and thus without
polish. Often times
the surface will appear
almost velvety.
The tints of the
flesh and the gills
will be found uniform.
The plant
when raw is sweet
and nut-like to the
taste. This is a
beautiful species, the
color being averaged
under the general hue
of dark, subdued red,
inclining to maroon.
It is simply delicious
when properly
cooked. Found in
woods from July to
September.</p>


<h3><i>Russula cyanoxantha. Fr.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Blue and Yellow Russula. Edible.</span></p>

<p>Cyanoxantha, from two Greek words, blue and yellow, referring to color
of the plant.</p>

<p>The pileus is quite variable as to color, ranging from lilac or purplish to
greenish; disk yellowish, margin bluish or livid-purple; convex, then plane, depressed
in center; margin faintly striate, sometimes wrinkled.</p>

<p>The gills are rounded behind, connected by veins, forked, white, slightly
crowded.</p>

<p>The stem is solid, spongy, stuffed, hollow when old, equal, smooth and white.</p>

<p>The color of the cap is quite variable but the peculiar combination of color<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
will assist the student in distinguishing it. It is a beautiful plant and one of
the best of the Russulas to eat. The mushroom-eater counts himself lucky
indeed when he can find a basketful of this species after "the joiner squirrel"
has satisfied his love of this special good thing. It is quite common in woods
from August to October.</p>


<h3><i>Russula vesca. Fr.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Edible Russula. Edible.</span></p>

<p>Vesca from vesco, to feed. The pileus is from two to three inches broad;
red-flesh-color, disk darker; fleshy; firm; convex, with a slight depression in the

<p>Gills adnate, rather crowded, unequal, forked, and white.</p>

<p>The stem is firm, solid, sometimes peculiarly reticulated, tapering at the base.
The spores are globose, spiny, and white. I frequently found it near Salem, O.,
in thin chestnut woods and in pastures under such trees. A mushroom lover will
be amply paid for the long tramps if he finds a basket full of these dainties. It is
mild and sweet when raw. It is found in thin woods and in wood margins, sometimes
under trees in pastures, from August to October.</p>

<p>Virescens, being green. The Pileus is grayish-green; at first globose, then
expanded, convex, at last depressed at the center; firm, adorned with flaky greenish
or yellow patches, produced by the cracking of the skin; two to four inches broad,
margin striate, often white.</p>

<p>The gills are white, moderately close, free or nearly so, narrow as they approach
the stem, some being forked, others not; very brittle, breaking to pieces
at the slightest touch.</p>

<p>The stem is shorter than the diameter of the cap, smooth, white, and solid
or spongy. The spores are white, rough, and nearly globose.</p>

<p>This plant is especially sweet and nutty to the taste when young and unwilted.
All Russulas should be eaten when fresh. I have found the plant over the state
quite generally. It is a prime favorite with the squirrels. You will often find them
half eaten by these little nibblers. Found in open woods from July to September.
It is one of the best mushrooms to eat and one that is very easily identified. It
is quite common about Chillicothe, Ohio. Its mouldy color is not as prepossessing
as the brighter hues of many far less delicious fungi, but it stands the test of use.</p>


<h3><i>Russula variata. Ban.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Variable Russula. Edible.</span></p>

<p>Pileus is firm, convex becoming centrally depressed or somewhat funnel-form,
viscid, even on the thin margin, reddish-purple, often variegated with green, pea-green
sometimes varied with purple, flesh white, taste acrid or tardily acrid.</p>

<p>The gills are thin, narrow, close, often forked, tapering toward each end,
adnate or slightly decurrent, white.</p>

<p>The stem is equal or nearly so, solid, sometimes cavernous, white. The spores
are white, subglobose, .0003 to .0004 of an inch long, .0003 broad. <i>Peck</i>, Rep.
State Bot., 1905.</p>

<p>This plant grows in open beech woods, rather damp, and appears in July
and August. The caps are often dark purple, often tinged with red, and sometimes
the caps contains shades of green. I found the plants plentifully in
Woodland Park, near Newtonville, Ohio, in July, 1907. We ate them on several
occasions and found them very good. The greenish margin and purplish center
will mark the plant.</p>


<h3><i>Russula integra. Fr.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Entire Russula. Edible.</span></p>

<p>Integra, whole or entire. The pileus is three or four inches in diameter,
fleshy; typically red, but changing color; expanded, depressed, with a viscid
cuticle, growing pale. Margin thin, furrowed and tuberculate. Flesh white,
sometimes yellowish above.</p>

<p>The stem is at first short and conical, then club-shaped or ventricose, sometimes
three inches long and up to one inch thick; spongy, stuffed, commonly
striate; even, and shining white.</p>

<p>The gills are somewhat free, very broad, sometimes three-fourths of an inch;
equal or bifid at the stem, rather distant and connected by veins; pallid or white,
at length light yellow, being powdered yellow with the spores.</p>

<p>Although the taste is mild it is often astringent. One of the most changeable
of all species, especially in the color of the pileus, which, though typically red, is
often found inclining to azure-blue, bay-brown, olivaceous, etc. It occasionally
happens that the gills are sterile and remain white. <i>Fries.</i></p>

<p>The spores are spheroid, spiny, pale ochraceous.</p>

<p>R. integra so closely resembles
R. alutacea that to distinguish them
requires a knowledge of both
plants, and even then one may not
feel quite sure; however, it matters
little as they are equally good. Its
powdery gills will help to distinguish
R. integra from R. alutacea.
Found from July to October.</p>

<p>The stem is stuffed, hollow, shining white.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>Quite as acrid as R. emetica, which it resembles in many ways, especially the
smaller plants. It can be distinguished by its thinner caps, thinner and crowded
gills, more ventricose and often slightly eroded at the edge. It is generally classed
among poisonous mushrooms; but Captain Charles McIlvaine in his book says:
"Though one of the peppery kind, I have not, after fifteen years of eating it, had
reason to question its edibility." I should advise caution. Eat of it sparingly till
sure of its effects. Found in woods from July to October.</p>

<p>Emetica means making sick, inciting to vomit. The pileus is fleshy, quite
viscid, expanded, polished, shining, oval, or bell-shaped when young; its color is
very variable from rose-red to a yellow-red or even purple; margin furrowed,
flesh white.</p>

<p>The gills are free, equal, broad, distant, white. The spores are round, 8Âµ.</p>

<p>The stem is stout, solid, though sometimes spongy stuffed, even, white or
reddish. The spores are white, round, and spiny.</p>

<p>This species is recognized by its very acrid taste and free gills. A distinct
channel will be seen between the gills and the stem. This very pretty mushroom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
is quite common in most parts of Ohio. I found it in abundance about Salem,
Bowling Green, Sidney, and Chillicothe&mdash;all in this state.</p>

<p>Captain McIlvaine states that he has repeatedly eaten it and cites a number
of others who ate it without bad results, although weight of authority would
band it a reprobate. I am glad to report something in its favor, for it is a beautiful
plant, yet I should advise caution in its use.</p>

<p>It is found in open woods or in pastures under trees, from July to October.
Its viscid cap will distinguish it.</p>

usually greenish-umber, sometimes
reddish; fleshy; compact;
nearly round, then expanded,
depressed in the center; even;
smooth; often sprinkled with a

<p>I have found it frequently on the wooded hillsides of the state. The taste
when raw is mild at first, but soon develops a slight bitterness which, however, is
lost in cooking. Fried in butter they are excellent. July to October.</p>

the Chanterelle. The entire plant is a rich egg-yellow. The pileus is fleshy, at
first convex, later flat, three to five inches broad, depressed in the center, finally
funnel-shaped; bright to deep yellow; firm, smooth, but often irregular, its margin
often wavy; flesh white, the cap has the appearance of an inverted cone.</p>

<p>The gills are decurrent, shallow and fluted, resembling swollen veins,
branched, more or less interconnected and tapering downward on the stem, color
the same as the pileus.</p>

<p>The stem is solid, variable in length, often curved, tapering towards the base,
paler than the pileus and gills.</p>

<p>It grows in woods and rather open places. I found it in great abundance in
Stanley's woods, near Damascus, Ohio. I have found it very often about
Chillicothe. The plant has a strong prune-like odor; when tasted raw they are
peppery and pungent but sweet and quite delicious when cooked. My friends and
myself have eaten it and pronounced very good. The plants in Figure 158 were
gathered near Columbus, Ohio, and photographed by Dr. Kellerman.</p>

<p>The pileus is fleshy, obconic, glabrous, alutaceous, or dingy cream-color, the
thin margin erect, often irregular and lobed, tinged with lilac in the young plant;
folds numerous, nearly straight in the margin, abundantly anastomosing below;
pale umber, tinged with lilac.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>The stem is short, tomentose-pubescent, ash-colored, solid, often tapering
downward. Spores yellowish, oblong-elliptical, uninucleate, 10&ndash;12Ã—5Âµ. <i>Peck</i>,
33d Rep., N. Y.</p>

<p>The plant is small; with us, not more than three inches high and the pileus
not more than two inches broad at the top. It differs somewhat in color, in the
character of the folds, and materially in the shape of the margin of the pileus.
Found occasionally on the hillsides of Huntington Township, near Chillicothe,
July to August.</p>

</div>

<p>Cinnabarinus means cinnabar-red, from the color of the plant.</p>

<p>The pileus is firm, convex, or slightly depressed in the center, often irregular
with wavy or lobed margin; glabrous, cinnabar-red, flesh white.</p>

<p>The gills are narrow, distant, branched, decurrent, of the same color as the
cap, dull on the edge.</p>

<p>The stem is equal or tapering downward, glabrous, solid, sometimes stuffed,
cinnabar-red.</p>

<p>The spores are elliptical, 8&ndash;10Âµ long, 4&ndash;5Âµ broad.</p>

<p>No one will have any difficulty in identifying this plant, since its color suggests
the name at once. It is quite common about Chillicothe and throughout the
state. It is found frequently with Craterellus cantharellus. It is a very pretty
plant, growing in open woods or along the roadside in woods. It will keep for
some time after it is gathered. It is found from July to October.</p>


<h3><i>Cantharellus infundibuliformis. Fr.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Funnel-Shaped Cantharellus.</span></p>

<p>Infundibuliformis means shaped like a funnel.</p>

<p>The pileus is one to two and a half inches broad, somewhat membranaceous,
umbilicate, then infundibuliform, usually perforated at the base, and opening
into the cavity of the stem, floccosely rugose on the surface, yellowish-gray or
smoky when moist, pale when dry, becoming wavy.</p>

<p>The gills are decurrent, thick, distant, regularly forked, straight, yellow or
cenereous, at length pruinose.</p>

along Ralston's Run, near Chillicothe.</p>


<h3><i>Hygrophorus. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Hygrophorus is from two Greek words meaning bearing moisture. So called
because the members of this genus may be known from their moist caps and the
waxy nature of the gills, which distinguish them from all others. As in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 205]<br />[Pg 206]</a></span>
Pleurotus, the gills of some of the species are rounded or notched at the end next
to the stem, but of others they are decurrent on it; hence, in some species they
are like the gills of Tricholoma in their attachment, in others they run down on
the stem as in the Clitocybe. In many of them both cap and stem are very viscid,
a characteristic not found in the Clitocybes; and the gills are generally thicker and
much farther apart than in that genus. A number of the species are beautifully
colored.</p>

<p>Pratensis, from pratum, a meadow. The pileus is one to two inches broad;
when young almost hemispherical, then convex, turbinate or nearly flat, the center
more or less convex, as if umbonate; margin often cracked, frequently contracted
or lobed; white or various shades of yellow, buffish-reddish, or brownish. Flesh
white, thick in the center, thin at the margin. The stem is stuffed, attenuated
downwards. The gills are thick, distant, white or yellowish, bow-shaped, decurrent,
and connected by vein-like folds. Spores are white, broadly elliptical,
.00024 to .00028 inch long.</p>

<p>The pasture hygrophorus is a small but rather stout-appearing mushroom.
It grows on the ground in pastures, waste places, clearings, and thin woods, from
July to September. Sometimes all white or gray.</p>

<p>Var. cinereus, Fr. Pileus and gills gray. The stem whitish and slender.</p>

<p>Var. pallidus, B. &amp; Br. Pileus depressed, edge wavy, entirely pale ochre.</p>

<p>Eburneus is from <i>ebur</i>, ivory. The pileus is two to four inches broad, sometimes
thin, sometimes somewhat compact, white; very viscid or glutinous in wet
weather, and slippery to the touch; margin uneven, sometimes wavy; smooth, and
shining. When young, the margin is incurved.</p>

<p>The gills are firm, distant, straight, strongly decurrent, with vein-like elevations
near the stem. The spores are white, rather long.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>The stem is unequal, sometimes long and sometimes short; stuffed, then
hollow, tapering downward, punctate above with granular scales. Odor and taste
are rather pleasant. It is found in woods and pastures in all parts of Ohio, but
it is not plentiful anywhere. I have found it only in damp woods about Chillicothe.
August to October.</p>


<h3><i>Hygrophorus cossus. Sow.</i></h3>

<p>Cossus, because it smells like the caterpillar, Cossus ligniperda.</p>

<p>The pileus is small, quite viscid, shining when dry, white with a yellow tinge,
edge naked, very strong-scented.</p>

<p>The gills are somewhat decurrent, thin, distant, straight, firm.</p>

<p>The stem is stuffed, nearly equal, scurvy-punctate upwards. Spores 8Ã—4.
Found in the woods. The strong smell will serve to identify the species.</p>


<h3><i>Hygrophorus chlorophanus. Fr.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Greenish-yellow Hygrophorus.</span></p>

<p>Chlorophanus is from two Greek words, meaning appearing greenish-yellow.</p>

<p>The pileus is one inch broad, commonly bright sulphur-yellow, sometimes
scarlet-tinted, not changing color; slightly membranaceous, very fragile, often
irregular, with the margin split or lobed, at first convex, then expanded; smooth,
viscid, margin striate.</p>

<p>The gills are emarginate, adnexed, quite ventricose, with a thin decurrent
tooth, thin, subdistant, distinct, pale-yellow.</p>

<p>The stem is two to three inches long, hollow, equal, round, viscid when
moist, shining when dry, wholly unicolorous, rich light-yellow.</p>

<p>The spores are slightly elliptical, 8Ã—5Âµ.</p>

<p>This species resembles in appearance H. ceraceus, but it can be identified by its
emarginate gills and somewhat larger form. The plant has a wide distribution,
having been found from the New England States through the Middle West. It
is found in damp, mossy places from August to October. I have no doubt of
its edibility. It has a mild and agreeable taste when eaten in the raw state.</p>

<p>Miniatus is from minium, red lead.</p>

<p>This is a small but a very common species, highly colored and very attractive.
The pileus and the stem are bright red and often vermilion. The pileus
is at first convex, but, when fully expanded, it is nearly or quite flat, and in wet
weather it is even concave by the elevation of the margin, smooth or minutely
scaly, often umbilicate. Its color varies from a bright red or vermilion or blood-red
to pale orange hues.</p>

<p>The gills are yellow and frequently strongly tinged with red, distant,
attached to the stem, and sometimes notched.</p>

<p>The stem is usually short and slender, colored like, or a little paler, than
the cap; solid, when young, but becoming stuffed or hollow with age. The
spores are elliptical, white, 8Âµ long.</p>

<p>The Vermilion mushroom grows in woods and in open fields. It is more
plentiful in wet weather. It seems to grow best where chestnut logs have decayed.
It can be found in such places in sufficient quantities to eat. Few mushrooms
are more tender or have a more delicate flavor. There are two other
species having red caps, Hygrophorus coccineus and H. puniceus, but both are

<p>The gills are adnate, whitish, becoming yellowish or sometimes tinged with
red, occasionally red on the edge.</p>

<p>The stem is colored like the pileus, whitish at the base, both it and the pileus
are very fragile.</p>

<p>This is more fragile than the typical form and retains its color better in
drying. <i>Peck</i>, 43d Rep.</p>

<p>This is a beautiful plant growing, as Figure 172 shows, on the lower dead
portion of the stems of bog moss or sphagnum. It grows very abundantly in
Buckeye Lake. The photograph was made by Dr. Kellerman. It is found from
July to October. These plants cook readily, have an excellent flavor and because
of their color make an inviting dish. I have eaten heartily of them several times.</p>

<p>Sordidus means a dirty white, or dingy, referring to the color of the caps, so
made by adhering earth.</p>

<p>The pileus is broadly convex or nearly plane, glabrous, slightly viscid, white,
but usually defiled by adhering dirt; the margin at first strongly involute, then
spreading or reflexed; flesh firm when young, tough when old.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>The gills are subdistant, adnate, or decurrent, white or creamy-white.</p>

<p>The stem is five to ten Cm. long, firm, solid, white.</p>

<p>The spores are elliptical, 6.5&ndash;7.5Ã—4&ndash;5Âµ. <i>Peck.</i></p>

<p>The specimens I found were clear white, growing among leaves and were
especially free from soil. The stems were short and were inclined to be slightly
ventricose. Dr. Peck says that this "species is distinguished from H. penarius
by its clear white color, though this is commonly obscured by the adhering dirt
that is carried up in the growth of the fungus." The young, growing plants were
strongly involute but the older plants were reflexed, giving the plants a funnel-shaped
appearance and giving the gills a much stronger decurrent appearance.
Found October 26th.</p>

<p>Serotinus means
late. So called because
it is late in the
season.</p>

<p>Pileus is fleshy but
thin, convex or nearly
plane, often with the
thin margin curved
upward, glabrous or
with a few obscure innate
fibrils, reddish in
the center, whitish
on the margin, flesh
white, taste mild.</p>

<p>The gills are thin,
subdistant, adnate or
decurrent, white, the
interspaces slightly
venose.</p>

<p>The stem is equal,
stuffed or hollow, glabrous, whitish. The spores are white, elliptic, .0003 of an
inch long, .0002 broad.</p>

<p>Pileus is 8&ndash;15 lines broad; stem about 1 inch long, 1.5&ndash;2.5 lines thick. <i>Peck.</i></p>

<p>Some specimens of this species were sent to me from Boston by Mrs. Blackford,
but after a careful study of them I was unable to place them. She then sent
them to Dr. Peck, who gave them their very appropriate name. Those in Figure
177 were sent me in December, 1907.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>They grow a number in the same locality and frequently in close groups or
tufts. They seem to delight in oak and pine woods. Dr. Peck observes that this
species is similar to Hygrophorus queletii, Bres., both in size and color, but the
general characteristics of the plants do not agree. He also says it is similar in
size and color to H. subrufescens, Pk., but differs materially in the specific
description.</p>


<h3><i>Panus. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Panus means swelling. The species under this genus are leathery plants,
having the stems lateral and sometimes wanting. They dry up but revive with
moisture. The gills are simple and thinner than the Lentinus, but with an entire,
acute edge. There are a few species which give a phosphorescent light when
growing on decayed logs. The genus closely resembles Lentinus but can be
readily recognized on account of the smooth edged gills. A number of good
authorities do not separate them but give both under the name Lentinus. This
genus abounds wherever there are stumps and fallen timber.</p>

<p>Stypticus means astringent, styptic. The pileus is coriaceous, kidney-shaped,
cinnamon-color, growing pale, cuticle breaking up into scales, margin entire or
lobed, surface nearly even, sometimes zoned.</p>

<p>The gills are thin, crowded, connected by veins, of same color as cap, determinate,
quite narrow.</p>

<p>The stem is lateral, quite short, swollen above, solid, compressed, pruinose,
paler than the gills.</p>

<p>It is found very plentifully on decayed logs and stumps, and at times it is
quite phosphorescent in its manifestations. It has an extremely unpleasant
astringent taste. One might as well eat an Indian turnip as this species. Just a
taste will betray it. Found from fall to winter.</p>


<h3><i>Panus strigosus. B. &amp; C.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Hairy Panus. Edible.</span></p>

<p>Strigosus, covered with stiff hairs. The pileus is sometimes quite large,
eccentric, covered with stiff hairs, margin thin, white.</p>

<p>The gills are broad, distant, decurrent, straw-color.</p>

<p>The stem is stout, two to four inches long, hairy like the pileus.</p>

<p>The favorite host of this species is an apple tree. I found a beautiful
cluster on an apple tree in Chillicothe. Its creamy whiteness and hairy cap and
short hairy stem will distinguish it from all other tree fungi. It is edible when
young, but soon becomes woody.</p>


<h3><i>Panus conchatus. Fr.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Shell Panus.</span></p>

<p>Conchatus means shell-shaped. The pileus is thin, unequal, tough, fleshy,
eccentric, dimidiate; cinnamon, then pale; becoming scaly; flaccid; margin often
lobed.</p>

<p>The gills are narrow, forming decurrent lines on the stem, often branched,
pinkish, then ochre.</p>

<p>The stem is short, unequal, solid, rather pale, base downy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>This species will frequently be found imbricated and very generally confluent.
Its shell-like form, its tough substance, and its thin pileus are its distinguishing
marks. The taste is pleasant but its substance very tough. Found from September
to frost.</p>

<p>This is a very plentiful plant about Chillicothe and is found throughout the
United States, although it is a rare plant in Europe. It is generally given in
American Mycology under the name Lentinus Lecomtei. It grows on logs and
stumps. The form of the plant is quite different when growing on the top of a
log or a stump, from those springing from the side. Those in the extreme left
of Figure 179 grew on the side of the log, while those in the center grew on the
top, in which case the plant has usually a funnel-shaped appearance.</p>

<p>The pileus is tough, reddish or reddish-brown, depressed, sinuate, bristling
with tufts of hair, the margin quite strongly incurved, cÃ¦spitose.</p>

<p>The gills are narrow and crowded, decurrent, considerably paler than the cap.</p>

<p>The stem is short, hairy, tawny; sometimes the stem is almost obsolete.</p>

<p>There is a slight tinge of bitterness in the plant when raw, but in cooking
this disappears. When prepared for food it should be chopped fine and well
cooked. It can be dried for winter use. It is found from spring to late fall.</p>

smooth; almost flesh color, varying to reddish-livid, sometimes violet tinted.</p>

<p>The gills are decurrent, rather distant, distinct behind, separate, simple, ruddy,
then tan-colored.</p>

<p>The stem is short, stout, oblique, gray, covered with a violaceous down. The
spores are 6Ã—3Âµ.</p>

<p>The plant is variable both in form and color. Sometimes shaded very slightly
with pink. It is not very common here. I found some very fine specimens
growing on a log near Spider Bridge, Chillicothe.</p>

<p>It is edible but quite tough.</p>


<h3><i>Panus levis. B. &amp; C.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></h3>

<p>Levis, light. Pileus two to three inches broad, orbicular, somewhat depressed,
white, covered with a dense mat of hair; margin inflexed and marked by triangular
ridges.</p>

<p>The gills are broad, entire, decurrent.</p>

<p>The stem is two to three inches long, attenuated upward, eccentric, lateral,
solid, hairy below like the pileus. The spores are white.</p>

<p>This certainly is a very beautiful plant and will hold the attention of the
collector. It is not common with us. I have found it only on hickory logs. It
is said to be of good flavor and to cook readily.</p>


<h3><i>Lentinus. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Lentinus means tough. The pileus is fleshy, corky, tough, hard and dry,
reviving when moist.</p>

<p>The stem is central or lateral and often wanting, but when present is continuous
with the cap.</p>

<p>The gills are tough, unequal, thin, normally toothed, decurrent more or less,
margin acute. The spores are smooth, white, orbicular.</p>

<p>All the species, so far as I know, grow on wood. They assume a great
variety of forms. This genus is very closely related to Panus in the dry, coriaceous
nature of the pileus and the gills, but it can be readily recognized by the toothed
margin of the gills.</p>

<p>This is quite a large, massive plant, growing in a sessile and imbricated manner.
It has appeared in large quantities for the past four years on an elm, very
slightly decayed, but in quite a damp and dark place. The reader will get some
idea of the size of the whole plant in Figure 181 if he will consider each pileus to be
five to six inches broad. They are built up one on top of another, overlapping each
other like shingles on a roof.</p>

<p>The pileus is fleshy but tough, shell-shaped, connate behind, longitudinally
rough, costate, corrugate, tan-colored, and the margin is strongly incurved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>The gills are broad, nearly white, flesh-colored near the base, coarsely toothed.</p>

<p>The stem is usually obsolete, yet in some cases it is apparent.</p>

<p>The spores are almost round and very small, .00006 inch in diameter. In all
plants which I have found the odor is somewhat strong and the taste is pungent.

<p>The pileus is fleshy and arid. The gills are corky, fan-like, branched, united
above by the tomentose pellicle, bifid, split longitudinally at the edge. The spores
somewhat round and white.</p>

<p>The two lips of the split edge of the gills are commonly revolute. This genus
is far removed from the type of Agaricini. It grows on wood and is very common.

</div>

<p>This is a very common plant, growing in the woods on branches and decayed
wood, where it can be found in both winter and summer.</p>

<p>The pileus is thin, adnate behind, somewhat extended, more or less fan-shaped
or kidney-shaped, simple, often much lobed, narrowed behind to the point
of attachment; whitish, downy, then strigose.</p>

<p>The gills are radiating, gray, then brownish-purple, and sometimes white,
branched, split along the edges and rather deeply rolled backwards. The spores
are nearly round, 5&ndash;6Âµ.</p>

<p>This is a very common species all over the world. I found it in the winter
of 1907 on decayed shade-trees along the streets of Chillicothe. It seems to be
partial to maple timber. Some call this S. alneum. It is very easily identified
from its purple gills being split.</p>


<h3><i>Trogia. Fr.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></h3>

<p>Trogia is so called in honor of the Swiss botanist, Trog.</p>

<p>The pileus is nearly membranaceous, soft, quite tough, flaccid, dry, flexible,
fibrillose, reviving when moist.</p>

<p>The gills are fold-like, venose, narrow, irregular, crisped.</p>


<h3><i>Trogia crispa. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Crispa means crisp or curled. The pileus tough, cup-shaped, reflexed, lobed,
villous, whitish or reddish toward the attachment, often tan-colored.</p>

<p>The gills are quite narrow, vein-like, irregular, more or less branched, blunt
on the edge, white or bluish-gray, quite crisped, edge not channeled.</p>

<p>The caps are usually very much crowded and imbricated. It revives during
wet weather and is found throughout the year, generally on beech limbs in our
woods.</p>

THE ROSY-SPORED AGARICS.</h2>


<p>The spores of this series are of great variety of color, including rosy, pink,
salmon-color, flesh-color, or reddish. In Pluteus, Volvaria, and most of Clitopilus,
the spores are regular in shape, as in the white-spored series; in the other genera
they are generally irregular and angular. There are not so many genera as in the
other series and fewer edible species.</p>


<h3><i>Pluteus. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Pluteus means a shed, referring to the sheds used to make a cover for besiegers
at their work, that they might be screened from the missiles of the enemy.</p>

<p>They have no volva, no ring on the stem. Gills are free from the stem, white
at first then flesh-color.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><i>Cervinus is from cervus, a deer.</i> The pileus is fleshy, bell-shaped, expanded,
viscid in wet weather, smooth, except a few radiating fibrils when young, margin
entire, flesh soft and white; color of the cap light-brown or fawn-color, sometimes
sooty, often more than three inches across the cap.</p>

<p>The gills are free from the stem, broad, ventricose, unequal in length, almost
white when young, flesh-colored when mature from the falling of the spores. The
stem is solid, slightly tapering upward, firm, brittle, white, spread over with a few
dark fibrils, generally crooked. The spores are broadly elliptical. The cystidia
in the hymenium on the gills will be of interest to those who have a microscope.</p>

<p>This is a very common mushroom about Chillicothe. It is found on logs,
stumps, and especially on old sawdust piles. Note how easily the stem is removed
from the cap. This will distinguish it from the genus Entoloma. You cannot get
anything in the market that will make a better fry than Pluteus cervinus; fried in
butter, it is simply delicious. Found from May to October.</p>

<p>The stem is equal, solid, pallid, or brown, usually paler at the top, velvety with
a short, close pile.</p>

<p>The spores are subglobose, about .0002 inch in diameter. The plant is two to
three inches high, pileus one to two inches broad, stem one to two lines thick.
<i>Peck</i>, 38th Rep. N. Y. State Bot.</p>

<p>This is a much smaller species than P. cervinus, but its esculent qualities are
quite as good. Found from July to October.</p>


<h3><i>Pluteus eximius. Smith.</i></h3>

<p><i>Eximius, choice, distinguished.</i> The pileus is fleshy, bell-shaped when young,
expanded, beautifully fringed on the margin, larger than the cervinus.</p>

<p>The gills are free, broad, ventricose, white at first, then rose-colored, flesh
white, and firm.</p>

<p>The stem is thick, solid, and clothed with fibers. Dr. Herbst, Fungal Flora of
the Lehigh Valley.</p>

<p>I found some beautiful specimens in George Mosher's icehouse. I am very
sorry I did not photograph them.</p>


<h3><i>Volvaria. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>The spores of this genus are regular, oval, rosy-spored. The veil is universal,
forming a perfect volva, distinct from the cuticle of the pileus. The stem is easily
separable from the pileus. The gills are free, rounded behind, at first white, then
pink, soft. Most of the species grow on wood. Some on damp ground, rich mold,
in gardens, and in hot-houses. One is a parasite on Clitocybe nebularis and
monadelphus.</p>

<p>Bombycina is from <i>bombyx</i>, <i>silk</i>. This plant is so called because of the
beautiful silky lustre of the entire plant. The pileus is three to eight inches broad,
globose, then bell-shaped, finally convex and somewhat umbonate, white, the
entire surface silky, in older specimens more or less scaly, sometimes smooth at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>

not thick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>The gills are free, very crowded,
broad, ventricose, flesh-colored,
not reaching the margin, toothed.
The stem is three to six inches
long, tapering upward, solid,
smooth, the tough volva remaining
like a cup at the base. The
spores are rosy in mass, smooth,
and elliptical. The volva is large,
membranaceous, somewhat viscid.</p>

<p>The plant in Figure 192 was
found August 16th, on a maple
tree where a limb had been broken,
on North High Street, Chillicothe.
Many people had passed
along and enjoyed the shade of the
trees but its discovery remained
for Miss Marian Franklin, whose
eyes are trained to see birds, flowers,
and everything beautiful in
nature.</p>

<p>I have found the plant frequently
about Chillicothe, usually solitary;
but on one occasion I found
three specimens upon one trunk,
apparently growing from the same
mycelial mass. The caps of two
of them were each five inches
across. It usually grows on maple
and beech. If you will observe a
hollow beech, or sugar snag of
which one side is broken away,
leaving the sheltered yet open nestling
place, you are very likely to
find snugly enscounced in its decaying
heart one or more specimens
of these beautiful silky
plants. The volva is quite thick
and frequently the plant, when in
the egg state, has the appearance
of a phalloid. Found from June
to October.</p>

<p>Umbonata, having an umbo or conical projection like the boss of a shield.
This plant is quite common on the richly manured lawns of Chillicothe. I have
found it from June to October. The pileus is white or whitish, sometimes grayish,
often smoky on the umbo; globose when young, bell-shaped, plane when fully
expanded, umbonate, smooth; slightly viscid when moist, shining when dry, inch
to an inch and a half broad. The flesh is white and very soft.</p>

<p>The gills are free, white at first, then from flesh-color to a reddish hue from
the rosy-colored spores; some of the gills are dimidiate, somewhat crowded,
broader in the middle.</p>

<p>The stem is two inches to two and a half long, tapering from the base up,
smooth, cylindrical, hollow and firm. The volva is always present, free, variously
torn, white and sometimes grayish.</p>

<p>The entire plant is silky when dry. I have found it growing in my buggy
shed. It is not abundant, though quite common. I have never eaten it, but I do
not doubt its edibility.</p>

<p>The pileus is explanate,
white, fibrillose, dry,
striate, center slightly
depressed when mature.</p>

<p>The gills are white, becoming
flesh-color, from
the color of the spores,
free, distant.</p>

<p>The stem is white,
smooth, volva split to the
base into four nearly
equal segments. The
spores are broadly elliptical,
5&ndash;6 mc.</p>

<p>This is the smallest
species of the Volvaria.
It grows on the ground among the weeds and is apt to escape the attention of the
collector unless he knows its habitat. It is quite likely that V. parvula is the
same plant as this. Also V. temperata, although it has a different habitat, seems
to be very near this species. The plants in Figure 195 were collected in Michigan
and photographed by Dr. Fischer. The volva is brown-tipped as shown in the
figure given.</p>


<h3><i>Volvaria volvacea. Bull.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Stove Volvaria.</span></p>

<p>It is called "The Stove Volvaria" because it has been found in old unused
stoves. Pileus fleshy, soft, bell-shaped, then expanded, obtuse, virgate, with
adpressed black fibrils. The gills are free, flesh-colored, and inclined to deliquesce.
The stem is solid, subequal, white. The volva loose, whitish. The spores are
smooth, elliptical.</p>

<p>This is a much smaller plant than the V. bombycina and grows in the ground.
It is often found in hot-houses and cellars.</p>


<h3><i>Entoloma. Fr.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></h3>

<p>Entoloma is from two Greek words; <i>entos</i>, within; <i>loma</i>, a fringe, referring
to the inner character of the veil, which is seldom even apparent. The members
of this genus have rosy spores which are prominently angular. There is neither
volva, nor annulus. The gills are attached to the stem or notched near the junction
of the gills and the stem. The pileus is fleshy and the margin incurved, especially
when young. The stem is fleshy, fibrous, sometimes waxy, continuous with the
pileus. It corresponds with Hypholoma, Tricholoma, and Hebeloma. It can
always be separated from the rosy-spored genera by the notched gills. The
flesh-colored spores and gills distinguish the Entoloma from the Hebeloma, which
has ochre-spored ones, and Tricholoma, which has white ones.</p>

<p>All the species, so far as I know, have rather a pleasant odor, and for that
reason it is highly necessary that the genus and species should be thoroughly
known, as they are all dangerous.</p>

<p>Rhodopolium is composed of two Greek words, rose and gray.</p>

<p>The pileus is two to five inches broad, hygrophanous; when moist dingy-brown
or livid, becoming pale when dry, isabelline-livid, silky-shining; slightly
fleshy, bell-shaped when young, then expanded and somewhat umbonate, or
gibbous, at length rather plane and sometimes depressed; fibrillose when young,
smooth when full grown; margin at first bent inwards and when large, undulated.
Flesh white.</p>

<p>The gills adnate, then separating, somewhat sinuate, slightly distant, broad,
white, then rose color.</p>

<p>The stem is two to four inches long, hollow; equal when smaller, when
larger, attenuated upward; white pruinate at the apex, otherwise smooth; slightly
striate, white, often reddish from spores. Spores 8&ndash;10Ã—6&ndash;8Âµ. <i>Fries</i>.</p>

<p>The plant is found in mixed woods and is rather common. Captain McIlvaine
reports it edible, but I have never eaten any of the Entolomas. Some of

<p>The stem is of the same
color as the pileus, but
lighter, striate, hollow, somewhat
twisted, and enlarged

<p>Plants gregarious or in troups or clusters, 6&ndash;8 cm. high; pileus 4&ndash;8 cm. broad;
stems 1&ndash;1.5 cm. thick.</p>

<p>The pileus is dark-gray to hair-brown or olive-brown, often subvirgate
with darker lines; gills light salmon-color, becoming dull; stem colored as the
pileus, but paler; in drying the stems usually become as dark as the pileus.</p>

<p>Pileus subviscid when moist, convex to expanded, plane or subgibbous, not
umbonate, irregular, repand, margin incurved; flesh white, rather thin, very thin
toward the margin.</p>

<p>Gills are broad, 1&ndash;1.5 cm. broad, narrowed toward the margin of the pileus,
deeply sinuate, the angles usually rounded, adnexed, easily becoming free, edge
usually pale, sometimes connected by veins, sometimes costate, especially toward
the margin of the pileus.</p>

<p>Basidia four-spored. Spores subglobose, about six angles, 8&ndash;10Âµ in diameter,
some slightly longer in the direction of the apiculus, pale-rose under the microscope.</p>

<p>Stem even, fibrous striate, outer bark subcartilaginous, flesh white, stuffed,
becoming fistulose.</p>

<p>Odor somewhat of old meal and nutty, not pleasant; taste similar.</p>

<p>Related to E. prunuloides, Fr., and E. clypeatum, Linn. Differs from the
former in dark stem and uneven pileus, differs from the latter in being subviscid,
with even stem, and pileus not umbonate and much more irregular, and differs
from both in subcostate gills. <i>Atkinson</i>.</p>

<p>The gills and stem are colored like the pileus. <i>Peck.</i></p>

<p>Dr. Peck says, "It is with some hesitation that this is proposed as a species,
its resemblance to another species is so close. The only difference is found in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 246]<br />[Pg 247]</a></span>
its color and in the absence of the prominent cusp
of that plant. In both species the pileus is so thin
that in well dried specimens, slender, dark, radiating
lines on it, mark the position of the lamellÃ¦ beneath,
although in the living plant these are not visible."
The plant in Figure 199 was found in Purgatory
Swamp near Boston, by Mrs. Blackford. They are
found in August and September.</p>


<h3><i>Entoloma clypeatum. Linn.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Buckler Entoloma.</span></p>

<p><i>Clypeatum, a shield or buckler.</i> The pileus is
slightly fleshy, lurid when moist, when dry gray
and rather shining, streaked, spotted, campanulate,
then expanded, umbonate, smooth, watery.</p>

<p>Gills just reaching the stem, rounded, ventricose,
somewhat distant, minutely toothed, dirty
flesh-color.</p>

<p>The stem is stuffed, then hollow, equal, round,
clothed with small fibers, becoming pale, covered
with a minute powdery substance. The flesh is
white when dry. This plant will be distinguished
usually by the amount of white mycelium at the base of the stem. Dr. Herbst
remarks that it is a genuine Entoloma. It is certainly a beautiful plant when fully
developed. It is found in woods and in rich grounds from May till September.
Label it poisonous until its reputation is established.</p>


<h3><i>Clitopilus. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Clitopilus is from <i>clitos</i>, a declivity; pilos, a cap. This genus has neither
volva nor ring. It is often more or less eccentric, margin at first involute; stem
fleshy, diffused upward into the pileus; the gills are white at first, then pink or
salmon-color as the plant matures and the spores begin to fall; decurrent, never
notched. The pileus is more or less depressed, darker in the center. The spores
are salmon-color, in some cases rather pale, smooth or warted. Clitopilus is
closely related to Clitocybe, the latter having white gills, the former pink. It
differs from Entoloma just as Clitocybe differs from Tricholoma. It can always
be distinguished from Eccilia because the stem is never cartilaginous at the
surface. It differs from the genus, Flammula, mainly in the color of the spores.</p>

often covered with a
frost-like bloom, margin
often wavy, bending
backward.</p>

<p>The gills are strongly
decurrent, comparatively
few of full
length, white, then
flesh-color.</p>

<p>The stem is solid,
white, naked, striate,
short. Spores, 7&ndash;8Ã—5.</p>

<p>This is one of the
most interesting plants
because of the various
forms it presents.</p>

<p>I have found it in
various parts of the
state and frequently
about Chillicothe. It
has a pleasant taste,
and an odor reminding
you of new meal. It is
tender and its flavor is
excellent.</p>

<p>Found in woods or open woods, especially where it is damp, and under beech
trees, as well as oak. Found from June to October.</p>

<p>The plants in Figure 200 were collected near Ashville, N. C., and photographed
by Prof. H. C. Beardslee.</p>

</div>

<p>Orcellus is a diminutive meaning a small cask; from <i>orca</i>, a cask.</p>

<p>The pileus is fleshy, soft, plane, or slightly depressed, often irregular, even
when young; slightly silky, somewhat viscid when moist; white or yellowish-white,
flesh white, taste
and odor farinaceous.</p>

<p>The gills are
deeply decurrent,
close, whitish, then
flesh-color.</p>

<p>The stem is short,
solid, flocculose, often
eccentric, thickened
above. The
spores are elliptical,
9&ndash;10Ã—5Âµ. <i>Peck</i>, 42d

<p>This plant resembles
the Plum
mushroom, C.
prunulus, very
closely in appearance,
taste and odor, but it is considerably smaller. It grows in wet weather, in
open fields and lawns. It is quite widely distributed in our state, having found it
in Salem, Bowling Green, Sidney, and Chillicothe. I frequently find it associated
with Marasmius oreades. The specimens in Figure 201 were found near Ashville,
N. C., and were photographed by Prof. H. C. Beardslee. Found from July to

<p>Abortivus means abortive or imperfectly developed; so called from its many
irregular and undeveloped forms.</p>

<p>The pileus is fleshy, firm, convex, or nearly plane, regular or irregular, dry,
clothed with a minute silky tomentum, becoming smoother with age, gray or
grayish-brown, flesh white, taste and odor subfarinaceous.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>The gills are slightly or deeply decurrent, at first whitish or pale gray, then

<p>The stem is nearly equal, solid, minutely flocculose, sometimes fibrous, striate,
paler than the pileus. <i>Peck</i>, 42d Report N. Y.</p>

<p>There are often three forms of this plant; a perfect form, an imperfect form,
and an abortive form as will be seen in Figure 203. The abortive forms seem
to be more common, especially in this locality. They will be taken at first to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
some form of puff-ball. They are found in open woods and in ravines. I found

<p>Subvilis means very cheap, insignificant.</p>

<p>The pileus is thin, centrally depressed or umbilicate, with the margin decurved,
hygrophanus, dark-brown, striate on the margin when moist, taste farinaceous.</p>

<p>The gills are subdistant, adnate, or slightly decurrent, whitish when young,
then flesh-colored.</p>

<p>The stem is slender, brittle, rather long, stuffed or hollow, glabrous, colored
like the pileus or a little paler.</p>

<p>The spores are angular, 7.5&ndash;10Âµ. <i>Peck</i>, 42d Rept.</p>

<p>This plant is distinguished from Clitopilus villis by its shining pileus, widely

<p>Noveboracensis, the New York Clitopilus. Pileus thin, convex, then expanded
or slightly depressed; dingy-white, cracked in areas or concentrically rivulose,
sometimes obscurely zonate; odor farinaceous, taste bitter.</p>

<p>Gills narrow, close, deeply decurrent, some of them forked, white, becoming
dingy, tinged with yellow or flesh-color.</p>

<p>Stem equal, solid, colored like the pileus, the mycelium white, often forming
white, branching, root-like fibers. Spores globose.</p>

<p>Prof. Beardslee thinks that this species is doubtless identical with <i>C. popinalis</i>
of Europe. He has submitted specimens and photographs to European mycologists,
who hold to this view.</p>

<p>I found this plant quite abundant on the Huntington Hills after heavy rains
in August. Their season is from August to October. The specimens in Figure 204
were found growing among leaves after a heavy rain October 10th. The plants
have a tendency to turn blackish if they are bruised in handling them.</p>

<p>Var. brevis. This is so called from its short stem. The margin of the pileus is
pure white when moist. Gills attached to the stem or slightly decurrent.</p>


<h3><i>Eccilia. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Eccilia is from a Greek verb
which means "I hollow out"; so
called because the hollow cartilaginous
stem expands upward into
a membranaceous pileus, whose
margin at first is incurved. Gills
decurrent, attenuated behind.</p>

<p>This genus corresponds with
Omphalia and is separated from
Clitopilus by the cartilaginous,
smooth stem.</p>

<p>The stem is one to two inches long, slender, smooth, hollow, wavy, same
color as the pileus, white tomentose at the base.</p>

<p>Spores irregularly oblong, rough, 7Ã—5Âµ.</p>

<p>It is found from Nova Scotia through the Middle West. It is commonly
reported in fir and pine woods but I find it on the hillsides about Chillicothe in
mixed woods. It is frequently found here associated with Boletinus porosus.</p>

which the specific name is derived.</p>

<p>This is a larger plant than
E. carneo-grisea; and it differs
materially in the character
of its spores, which are
strongly angled and some
of them square, 10&ndash;12Âµ in
diameter, with a prominent
mucro at one angle.
It is found in the woods
from September to frost.</p>


<h3><i>Leptonia. Fr.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></h3>

<p>Leptonia means slender, thin.</p>

<p>The spores are salmon-color and irregular. The pileus is never truly fleshy,
cuticle always torn into scales, disk umbilicate, and often darker than the margin
which is at first incurved. The gills are attached to the stem and easily separated
in old plants. The stem is rigid, with cartilaginous bark, hollow or stuffed,
smooth, shining, often dark-blue, confluent with the cap.</p>

<p>The gills are attached to the stem, with a dark serrulate edge.</p>

<p>The stem is thin, cartilaginous, paler than the pileus.</p>


<h3><i>Nolanea. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Nolanea means a little bell, so called from the shape of the pileus.</p>

<p>It is rosy-spored. The stem is cartilaginous and hollow. The pileus is submembranaceous,
thin, bell-shaped, papillate, margin straight, pressed close to the
stem. The gills are free and not decurrent. They are found growing on the
ground in the woods and pastures.</p>


<h3><i>Nolanea pascua. P.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Pasture Nolanea.</span></p>

<p>Pascua means pasture.</p>

<h3><i>Claudopus. Smith.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></h3>

<p>Claudopus is from two Greek words: <i>claudos</i>, lame; <i>pus</i>, foot.</p>

<p>The pileus is eccentric or lateral like the Pleuroti. The species were formerly
placed in the Pleuroti and Crepidoti, which they very closely resemble, save in the
color of the spores. This genus formerly included those plants which have lilac
spores, but Prof. Fries limited it to those which have pink spores. The spores in
some species are even and in others, rough and angular. The stem is either
wanting or very short, hence its name. All are found on decayed wood.</p>

<p>Nidulans is from <i>nidus</i>, a
nest.</p>

<p>The pileus is sessile, sometimes
narrowed behind into a
short stem-like base, caps often
overlapping one another,
kidney-shaped, quite downy,
the margin involute, hairy toward
the margin, a rich yellow
or buff color.</p>

<p>The gills are broad, moderately
close, orange-yellow.</p>

<p>The spores are even,
3&ndash;5Ã—1Âµ, elongated, somewhat
curved, delicate pink in mass. It is quite common in the woods about Chillicothe.
A maple log from which I secured the specimen photographed in Figure 208 was
completely covered and presented a beautiful sight. It has a rather strong and
disagreeable odor. It is edible, but generally tough, and must be chopped very fine
and cooked well. It is found in woods, on logs and stumps, from August to
November.</p>


<h3><i>Claudopus variabilis. Pers.</i></h3>

<p><i>Variabilis, variable or changeable.</i> The pileus is white, thin, resupinate&mdash;that
is the plant seems to be on its back, the gills being turned upward toward the light,
quite downy, even, being fastened in the center to a short downy stem.</p>

<p>The gills are at first white, then of the color of the spores.</p>

<p>It is found on decaying limbs and branches in the woods. It is quite common

THE RUSTY-SPORED AGARICS.</h2>


<p>The spores are of various shades of ochre yellow, rusty, rusty-brown, brown,
yellowish-brown. The hymenophore is never free from the stem in the rusty-spored
series, nor is there a volva.</p>


<h3><i>Pholiota. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Pholiota, a scale. The members of this genus have rusty spores. These may
be sepia-brown, bright yellowish-brown or light red. There is no volva, but there
is a ring which is sometimes persistent, friable, and fugacious. In this respect it
corresponds with the Armillaria among the white spored agarics. The pileus is
fleshy. The gills are attached to the stem and sometimes notched with a decurrent
tooth, tawny or rusty in color on account of the falling of the spores. Many
species grow on wood, logs, stumps, and branches of trees, although others grow
on the ground.</p>

<p><i>Precox, early.</i> Pileus is fleshy, soft, convex, then expanded, at length
smooth, even, margin at first incurved; moist but not sticky, whitish, often with
slight tinge of yellow or tan-color; when the plant is fully matured it is often
upturned and fluted.</p>

<p>The gills are attached to the stem and slightly decurrent by a tooth, moderately
broad, crowded, unequal, creamy white, then rusty-brown. Spores brownish,
8&ndash;13Ã—6&ndash;7Âµ.</p>

<p>The stem is stuffed, then hollow, often striate above the ring, rather slender,
sometimes mealy, skin peeling readily, whitish. The spores are rusty-brown and
elliptical. The caps are from one to two inches broad, and the stem is from two
to three inches long. The veil is stretched like a drumhead from the stem to the
margin of the cap. It varies in manner of breaking; sometimes it separates from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
the margin of the cap and forms a ring around the stem; again, but little remains
on the stem and much on the rim of the cap.</p>

<p>It appears every year on the Chillicothe high school lawn. The gills are
creamy-white when the cap first opens, but they soon turn to a rusty-brown.
It comes in May. I have never found it after June. I am always delighted to
find it for it is always appetizing at that season. Look for them on lawns and
pastures and in grain fields.</p>

<p>Dura, hard; so called because the surface of the cap becomes quite hard and
cracked. The pileus is from three to four inches or more broad, very compact,
convex, then plane, cuticle often very much cracked, margin even, tawny, tan-color,
sometimes quite brown.</p>

<p>The gills are firmly attached to the stem, somewhat decurrent with a tooth,
ventricose, livid, then a brown rusty color. Spores elliptical, 8&ndash;9Ã—5&ndash;6Âµ.</p>

<p>The stem is stuffed, hard, externally fibrous, thickened toward the apex,
sometimes ventricose, often irregularly shaped.</p>

<p>On June 6th, 1904, I found Mr. Dillman's garden on Hickory street, Chillicothe,
white with this plant. Some were very large and beautiful and I had an
excellent opportunity to observe the irregularity in the form of the stem. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
years previous I found a garden in Sidney, Ohio, equally filled. In the fall of
1905 I was asked to drive out about seven miles from Chillicothe to see a wheat-field,
the last of October, that was white with mushrooms. I found them to be of
this species.</p>

<p>Adiposa is from <i>adeps</i>, fat. The pileus is showy, deep-yellow, compact, convex,
obtuse, slightly umbonate, quite viscid when moist, shining when dry; cuticle
plain or broken into scales which are dark-brown, the margin incurved; the flesh
is saffron-yellow, thick at the center and thinning out toward the margin.</p>

<p>The gills are firmly attached to the stem, sometimes slightly notched, close,
yellow, then rust-color with age. Spores elliptical, 7Ã—3Âµ.</p>

<p>The stem is equal, stuffed, tough, thickening at the base, brown below and
yellow above, quite scaly.</p>

<p>The beautiful appearance of the tufts or clusters in which the Pineapple
Pholiotas grow will attract the attention of an ordinarily unobservant beholder.
The scales on the cap seem to contract and rise from the surface and sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
disappear with age. The caps of mushrooms should not ordinarily be peeled before
cooking, but it is better to peel this one.</p>

the sides, the entire cap and especially at the center is covered with a white
superficial flocci.</p>

<p>The gills are adnate or attached to the stem, rather crowded, this, somewhat

slight, often only a trace, as will be seen on the left hand plant in Figure 212.</p>

<p>The spores are dark ferruginous when caught on white paper, but paler on
dark paper.</p>

<p>The white superficial flocci will mark the plant. It has a wide distribution
throughout the states. I found it in a number of places in Ohio and it is quite

<h3><i>Pholiota mutablis. Schaff.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Changeable Pholiota. Edible.</span></p>

<p>Mutablis means changeable, variable. The pileus two to three inches broad,
fleshy; deep cinnamon when moist, paler when dry; margin rather thin, transparent;
convex, then expanded, sometimes obtusely umbonate, and sometimes
slightly depressed; even, quite smooth, flesh whitish and taste mild.</p>

<p>The gills are broad, adnate, slightly decurrent, close, pale umber, then cinnamon-color.</p>

<p>The stem is two to three inches long, slender, stuffed, becoming hollow,
smooth above or minutely pulverulent, and pale, below slightly scaly up to the
ring, and darker at the base, ring membranaceous, externally scaly. The spores
are ellipsoid, 9&ndash;11Ã—5&ndash;6Âµ.</p>

<p>I find this specimen growing in a cÃ¦spitose manner on decayed wood. It
is quite common here late in the season. I found some very large specimens on
Thanksgiving day, 1905, in Gallia County, Ohio. It is one of the latest edible
plants.</p>

<h3><i>Inocybe. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Inocybe is from two Greek words meaning fiber and head; so called from
the fibrillose veil, concrete with the cuticle of the pileus, often free at the margin, in
the form of a cortina. The gills are somewhat sinuate, though they are sometimes
adnate, and in two species are decurrent; changing color but not powdered with
cinnamon. Spores are often rough but in other specimens are even, more or less

<p>This is a very interesting species. It is thus described by Dr. Peck: "Veil
conspicuous, webby fibrillose, margin of the pileus more fibrillose; stem longer and
more conspicuously fibrillose. The well developed veil, and the longer stem, are
the distinguishing characters of this variety."</p>

<p>The plants are found in mossy patches on the north hillsides about Chillicothe.
The pale ochraceous yellow and the very fibrillose caps and stem will attract the
attention of the collector at once. The caps are one to two and a half inches
broad and the stem is two to three inches long.</p>

trees and keeping close to the walks. The whitened margin of the young plant
is a very good ear-mark by which to know this species.</p>


<h3><i>Pluteolus. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Pluteolus means a small shed. It is the diminutive of <i>pluteus</i>, a shed or penthouse,
from its conical cap.</p>

<p>The pileus is rather fleshy, viscid, conical or campanulate, then expanded;
margin at first straight, adpressed to the stem. Stem somewhat cartilaginous,
distinct from the hymenophore. Gills free, rounded behind.</p>

<p>The stem is one to two inches long, hollow, fragile, fibrillose, inclined to be
mealy at the top, white.</p>

<p>I have found only a few plants of this species in our state. It seems to be
rare. The anastomosing veins on the cap and its pale violaceous color will mark
the species. I have always found it on decayed wood. Captain McIlvaine speaks
of finding it in quantities on the stems of fallen weeds and says it was tender and
of fine flavor. September.</p>


<h3><i>Galera. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Galera means a small cap. The pileus is more or less bell-shaped, margin
straight, at first depressed to the stem, hygrophanous, almost even, atomate when
dry, more or less membranaceous.</p>

<p>The gills are attached to the stem or with a decurrent tooth, as in Mycena.</p>

<p>The stem is cartilaginous, hollow, confluent with, but different in texture

bell-shaped, hygrophanous,
ochraceous when dry.</p>

<p>The gills are attached to
the stem, crowded, rather
broad, ascending, cinnamon-brown,
the edges whitish,
sometimes slightly serrate.</p>

<p>The stem is straight, hollow,
fragile, rather shining;
three to four inches long,
equal or sometimes inclined
to thicken downward, of
nearly the same color as the
pileus. The spores are elliptical
and a dark rust-color,
12&ndash;13Ã—7Âµ.</p>

<p>You will frequently meet
a variety whose cap and stem
are quite pubescent but
whose other characteristics
agree with G. tenera. Prof.
Peck calls it G. tenera var.
pilosella.</p>

<p>Found in richly manured lawns and pastures. It is quite common. The
caps, only, are good.</p>


<h3><i>Galera lateritia. Fr.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Brick-Red Galera. Edible.</span></p>

<p>Lateritia means made of brick, from <i>later</i>, a brick; so called because the caps
are brick-colored.</p>

<p>The pileus is somewhat membranaceous, cone-shaped, then bell-shaped, obtuse,
even, hygrophanous, rather pale yellow when wet, ochraceous when dry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p>The gills are almost free, adnexed to
the top of the cone, linear, very narrow,
tawny or ferruginous.</p>

<p>The stem is three to four inches long,
hollow, slightly tapering upward,
straight, fragile, white pruinose, whitish.
Spores are elliptical, 11&ndash;12Ã—5&ndash;6Âµ.</p>

<p>This plant resembles G. ovalis, from
which it can be distinguished by its
linear ascending gills and the absence
of a veil.</p>

<p>Found on dung and in richly manured
pastures, from July to frost.</p>

</div>

<p>Kellermani is named in honor of Dr.
W. A. Kellerman, Ohio State University.</p>

<p>The pileus is very thin, subovate or
subconic, soon becoming plane or nearly
so; striatulate nearly to the
center when moist, more or
less wavy and persistently
striate on the margin when
dry, minutely granulose or
mealy when young, unpolished
when mature, often
with a few scattered floccose
squamules when young, and
sometimes with a few slight
fragments of a veil adhering
to the margin which appears
as if finely notched by the
projecting ends of the gills;
watery-brown when moist,
grayish-brown when dry, a
little darker in the center;
taste slight, odor faint, like
that of decaying wood.</p>

<p>The gills are thin, close,
adnate, a delicate cinnamon-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>brown
becoming darker with age. The stem is two and a half to four cm. long,
slender, equal, or slightly tapering upward; finely striate, minutely scurvy or
mealy, at least when young; hollow, white. The spores are brownish ferruginous
with a faint pinkish tint in mass, elliptic, 8&ndash;12Ã—6&ndash;7Âµ. <i>Peck.</i></p>

<p>Dr. Peck says the distinguishing features of this species are its broadly
expanded or plane grayish-brown pileus, with its granulose or mealy surface, its
persistently striate margin, and its very narrow gills becoming brownish with age.
I have seen the plant growing in the culture beds in the greenhouse of the Ohio
State University. It is a beautiful plant. Plants of all ages are shown in Figures
224 and 225.</p>

  </a>
  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure</span> 226.&mdash;Galera crispa. Natural size. Cap ochraceous-brown.</p>
</div>

<p>Crispa means crisped; the specific name is based on the peculiar character of
the gills which are always crisped as soon as the pileus is expanded.</p>

<p>The pileus is 1.5 to 3.5 cm. broad, membranaceous, persistently conico-campanulate,
subacute, uneven and somewhat rivulose, ochraceous-brown on disk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
lighter toward the margin which becomes crenulate and upturned in older specimens;
slightly pruinose at first, rugulose and a little paler when dry.</p>

<p>The gills are adnexed, not crowded, rather narrow, interspersed with
anastomosing veins; much crisped; at first nearly white, then becoming ferruginous
from the spores.</p>

<p>The stem is 7 to 10 cm. long, tapering from a somewhat bulbous base, yellowish-white,
pruinose at base, hollow, fragile. The spores are 8&ndash;10Âµ broad, 12&ndash;16Âµ
long. <i>Longyear.</i></p>

<p>They are found in grass on lawns and in pastures, June and July.</p>

<p>Dr. Peck, to whom specimens were referred, suggested that they may be a
variety of G. lateritia, unless the peculiar character of the gills proved to be
constant. Prof. Longyear has found the plant frequently in Michigan and it was
found by him in the City Park, Denver, Col., in July, 1905.</p>

<p>Its distinguishing characteristic is sufficiently constant to make the recognition
of the species a matter of ease. The plants in Figure 226 were photographed by
Prof. B. O. Longyear.</p>


<h3><i>Galera ovalis. Fr.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Oval Galera.</span></p>

<p>The pileus is somewhat membranaceous, oval or bell-shaped, even, watery,
dusky-rust color, somewhat larger than G. tenera.</p>

<p>The gills are almost free, ventricose, very broad, rust-colored.</p>

<p>The stem is straight, equal, slightly striate, nearly of the same color as the
cap, about three inches long. Found in pastures where stock has been. I have
found it in the Dunn pasture, on the Columbus pike, Ross County, O.</p>


<h3><i>Crepidotus. Fr.</i></h3>

<p><i>Crepidotus</i> is from a Greek word meaning a slipper. The spores are dark
or yellowish-brown. There is no veil. The pileus is excentric, dimidiate or
resupinate. The flesh is soft. The stem is lateral or wanting, when present it
is continuous with the cap. They generally grow on wood.</p>

<p>This is a very modest little plant growing on the underside of rotten logs
or bark, thus, no doubt, escaping the attention of many. Sometimes it may be
found growing from the side of a log, in which case it grows in a shelving form.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
When growing under the log the upper side of the cap is against the wood and
it is said to be resupinate.</p>

<p>The pileus is kidney-form, quite small, thin, pure white, covered with a soft
whitish down.</p>

<p>The gills are radiate from the point of attachment of the cap, not crowded,
whitish, then ferruginous from the spores.</p>


<h3><i>Crepidotus mollis. Schaeff.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Soft Crepidotus.</span></p>

<p>The pileus is between subgelatinous and fleshy; one to two inches broad;
sometimes solitary, sometimes imbricated; flaccid, even, smooth, reniform, subsessile,
pallid, then grayish.</p>

<p>The gills are decurrent from base, crowded, linear, whitish then watery
cinnamon. The spores are elliptical, ferruginous, 8&ndash;9Ã—5&ndash;6Âµ.</p>

<p>This species is widely distributed and quite common on decayed logs and
stumps, from July to October.</p>


<h3><i>Naucoria. Fr.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></h3>

<p>Naucoria, a nut shell. The pileus is some shade of yellow, convex, inflexed,
smooth, flocculent or scaly. The gills are attached to the stem, sometimes nearly
free, never decurrent. The stem is cartilaginous, confluent with the cap but of
a different texture, hollow or stuffed. The veil is absent or sometimes small
traces may be seen attached to the rim of the pileus, in young plants in the form
of flakes. The spores are of various shades of brown, dull or bright. They
grow on the ground on lawns and rich pastures. Some on wood.</p>


<h3><i>Naucoria hamadryas. Fr.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Nymph Naucoria. Edible.</span></p>

<p>Hamadryas, one of the nymphs whose life depended upon the tree to which
she was attached.</p>

<p>The pileus is one to two inches broad, rather fleshy, convex, expanded,
gibbous, even, bay-ferruginous when young and moist, pale yellowish when old.</p>

<p>The gills are attenuated, adnexed, almost free, rusty, slightly ventricose,
somewhat crowded.</p>

<p>The stem is hollow, equal, fragile, smooth, pallid, two to three inches long.
The spores are elliptical, rust-color, 13&ndash;14Ã—7Âµ.</p>

<p>This is quite a common species, often growing alone along pavements, under
shade trees, and in the woods. The caps only are good. Found from June to
November.</p>

  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure</span> 228.&mdash;Naucoria pediades. Natural size.</p>
</div>

<p>Pediades is from a Greek word meaning a plain or a field, referring to its
being found on lawns and pastures.</p>

<p>The pileus is somewhat fleshy, convex, then plane, obtuse or depressed, dry,
finally opaque, frequently inclined to be minutely rivulose.</p>

<p>The gills are attached to the stem but not adnate to it, broad, subdistant,
only a few entire brownish, then a dingy cinnamon.</p>

<p>The stem is pithy or stuffed, rather wavy and silky, yellowish, base slightly
bulbous. The spores are of a brownish-rust color, 10&ndash;12Ã—4&ndash;5Âµ.</p>

<p>If the small bulb at the base of the stem is examined, it will be found to
be formed chiefly of mycelium rolled together around the base. It is found on
lawns and richly manured pastures from May to November. Use only the caps.
This plant is usually known as semiorbicularis.</p>

<p>Stem same color as pileus but paler, cartilaginous; floccose from loose
threads or, in some cases, abundant threads over the surface; becoming hollow,
base bulbous, the extreme base covered with whitish mycelium.</p>

<p>Veil rather thick, floccose, disappearing, leaving remnant on stem and margin
of pileus when fresh. <i>Atkinson.</i></p>

<p>Dr. Kellerman and I found this plant growing on living sphagnum, other
mosses and on rotten wood on Cranberry Island, in Buckeye Lake, Ohio. Figure
229 will illustrate its mode of growth, and the older plant with upturned cap will
show the conspicuous clay-brown scales of the pileus. The plants are found in
September and October.</p>


<h3><i>Flammula. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Flammula means a small flame; so called because many of the species have
bright colors. The spores are ferruginous, sometimes light yellow. The cap
is fleshy and at first usually inrolled, bright colored; veil filamentous, often
wanting. The gills are decurrent or attached with a tooth. The stem is fleshy,
fibrous, and of the same character as the cap.</p>

<p>The species of the Flammula are mostly found on wood. A few are found
on the ground.</p>


<h3><i>Flammula flavida. Schaeff.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Yellow Flammula.</span></p>

<p>Flavida means yellow.</p>

<p>The pileus is fleshy, convex, expanded, plane, equal smooth, moist, margin

<p>Carbonaria is so called because it is found on charcoal or burned
earth.</p>

<p>The pileus is quite fleshy, tawny-yellow, at first convex, then becoming
plane, even, thin, viscid, margin of the cap at first inrolled,
flesh yellow.</p>

<p>The gills are firmly attached to the stem, clay-colored or brown, moderately
close.</p>

<p>The stem is stuffed or nearly hollow, slender, rigid, squamulose, pallid,
quite short.</p>

<p>The spores are ferruginous-brown, elliptical, 7Ã—3.5Âµ.</p>

<p>I have found this species quite frequently where an old stump had been
burned out. It is gregarious. I have only found it from September to November
but the specimens in Figure 230 were sent to me in May, from Boston.
They were found in great abundance in Purgatory Swamp, where the grass and
vegetation had been burned away.</p>


<h3><i>Flammula fusus. Batsch.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></h3>

<h3><i>Paxillus. Fr.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></h3>

<p>Paxillus means a small stake or peg. The spores as well as the entire plant are
ferruginous. The pileus, with an involute margin, gradually unfolds. It may
be symmetrical or eccentric. The stem is continuous with the hymenophore. The
gills are tough, soft, persistent, decurrent, branching, membranaceous, usually
easily separating from the hymenophore.</p>

<p>The distinctive features of this genus are the involute margin and the soft,
tough, and decurrent gills which are easily separable from the hymenophore. Some
grow on the ground, others grow on stumps and sawdust.</p>

<p>Involutus means rolled inward. The pileus is two to four inches broad, fleshy,
compact, convex, plane, then depressed; viscid when moist, the cap being covered
with a fine downy substance, so that when the margin of the cap unrolls the marks
of the gills are quite prominent; yellowish or tawny-ochraceous, spotting when
bruised.</p>

<p>The gills are decurrent, branched; anastomosing behind, near the stem; easily
separating from the hymenophore.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>The stem is paler than the pileus, fleshy, solid, firm, thickened upward, brown
spotted.</p>

<p>The flesh is yellowish, changing to reddish or brownish when bruised. The
spores are rust-colored and elliptical, 8&ndash;10Âµ. It is found on the ground and decayed
stumps. When found on the side of a decayed stump or a moss-covered log the
stem is usually eccentric, but in other cases it is generally central.</p>

<p>It will be found around swampy places in an open woods. I found quite large
specimens around a swamp in Mr. Shriver's woods near Chillicothe, but they were
too far gone to photograph. It is edible but coarse. It appears from August to
November. Some authors call it the Brown Chantarelle.</p>

<p>Rhodoxanthus means a yellow rose. The pileus is one to two inches broad,
convex, then expanded, cushion-shaped, the epidermis of the cap often cracked
showing the yellow flesh, resembling very much Boletus subtomentosus; reddish-yellow
or chestnut-brown. The flesh is yellow and the cap dry.</p>

<p>The gills are decurrent, somewhat distant, stout, chrome yellow, occasionally
forked at the base; anastomosing veins quite prominent, the cystidia being very
noticeable.</p>

<p>The stem is firm, stout, of the same color as the cap, perhaps paler and more
yellow at the base. The spores are oblong, yellow, 8&ndash;12Ã—3&ndash;5Âµ.</p>

<p>This is one of the most troublesome plants whose genus we have to settle.
One of my mycological friends advised me to omit it from the genus altogether.
It has been placed in various genera, but I have followed Prof. Atkinson and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
classed it under Paxillus. The plant is widely distributed. I find it frequently
about Chillicothe. It is edible. Found in August, September and October. A full
discussion of the plant will be found in Prof. Atkinson's book.</p>


<h3><i>Cortinarius. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Cortinarius is from <i>cortina</i>, a curtain, alluding to a cobwebby veil seen only
in the comparatively young plants. Sometimes, parts of it will seem more substantial,
remaining for a time on the margin of the cap or on the stem. The color
of the pileus varies and its flesh and that of the stem are continuous. The
hymenophore and the gills are continuous. The gills are attached to the stem,
frequently notched, membranaceous, persistent, changing color, dry, powdery,
with rusty-yellow spores which drop slowly. The veil and gills are the chief
marks of distinction. The former is gossamer-like and separate from the cuticle,
and the latter are always powdered. It is always essential to note the color of the
gills in the young plant, since color is variable and sometimes shows only the
slightest trace on the stem, colored from the falling spores.</p>

<p>Most authorities divide the genus into six tribes, from the appearance of the
pileus. They are as follows:</p>

<p>I. Phlegmacium, meaning a shiny or clammy moisture. The pileus has a
continuous pellicle, viscid when moist, stem dry, veil spider-webby.</p>

<p>II. Myxacium, meaning mucus, slime; so called from the glutinous veil.
The pileus is fleshy, glutinous, rather thin; the gills are attached to the stem,
slightly decurrent; the stem is viscid, polished when dry, slightly bulbous.</p>

<p>III. Inoloma, meaning a fibrous fringe; from <i>is</i>, genitive <i>inos</i>, a fibre; and
<i>loma</i>, a fringe.</p>

<p>The pileus is fleshy, dry, not hygrophanous or viscid, silky with innate scales;
the gills may be violaceous, pinkish-brown, yellow at first, then in all cases cinnamon-color
from the spores; the stem is fleshy and somewhat bulbous; veil simple.</p>

<p>IV. Dermocybe, meaning a skinhead; from <i>derma</i>, skin, and <i>cybe</i>, a head.</p>

<p>The pileus thin and fleshy, entirely dry, at first clothed with silky down,
becoming smooth in mature plants. The gills are changeable in color. The stem
is equal or tapering downward, stuffed, sometimes hollow, smooth.</p>

<p>V. Telamonia, meaning a bandage or lint. The pileus is moist, watery,
smooth or sprinkled with whitish superficial fibres, the remnants of the web-like
veil. The flesh is thin, somewhat thicker at the center. The stem is ringed and
frequently scaly from the universal veil, slightly veiled at the apex, hence almost
with a double veil. The plants are usually quite large.</p>

<p>VI. Hydrocybe, meaning water-head or moist head. The pileus is moist,
not viscid, smooth or sprinkled with a whitish superficial fibril, flesh changing
color when dry, and rather thin. The stem is somewhat rigid and bare. Veil
thin, fibrillose, rarely forming a ring. Gills also thin.</p>

<h3><i>Cortinarius purpurascens. Fr.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Purplish Cortinarius. Edible.</span></p>

<p>Purpurascens means becoming purple or purplish; so named because the
blue gills become purple when bruised.</p>

<p>The pileus is four to five inches broad, bay-brown, viscid, compact, wavy,
spotted when old; often depressed at the margin, sometimes bending back; the
flesh blue.</p>

<p>The gills are broadly notched, crowded, bluish-tan, then cinnamon-color, becoming
purplish when bruised.</p>

<p>The stem is solid, bulbous, clothed with small fibres, blue, very compact, juicy;
becoming purplish when rubbed. The spores are elliptical, 10&ndash;12Ã—5&ndash;6Âµ.</p>

<p>This is one of the delicious mushrooms to eat, the stem cooking tender as

Hollow near Chillicothe. September to November.</p>


<h3><i>Cortinarius turmalis. Fr.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Yellow-Tan Cortinarius. Edible.</span></p>

<p>Turmalis means of or belonging to a troop or a squadron, turma; so called
because occurring in groups, and not solitary.</p>

<p>The pileus is two to four inches broad, viscid when wet, ochraceous-yellow,
smooth, discoid, flesh soft; veil extending from the margin of the cap to the stem
in delicate arachnoid threads, best seen in young plants.</p>

<p>The gills are emarginate, decurrent, depending upon the age of the plant;
crowded, somewhat serrated, whitish at first, then brownish-ochraceous-yellow.
The remnants of the veil will usually show above the middle of the stem as a zone
of minute striÃ¦, darker than the stem.</p>

<p>I found specimens on Cemetery Hill under pine trees. September to
November.</p>


<h3><i>Cortinarius olivaceo-stramineus. Kauff. n. Sp.</i></h3>

<p>Olivaceo-stramineus means an olive straw-color.</p>

<p>Pileus 4&ndash;7 cm. broad, viscid from a glutinous cuticle, broadly convex, slightly
depressed in the center when expanded; margin incurved for some time; pale-yellow
with an olivaceous tinge, slightly rufous-tinged when old; smooth or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
silky-fibrillose, disk sometimes covered with minute squamules, shreds of the
partial veil attached to the margin when expanded. Flesh very thick, becoming
abruptly thin toward the margin, white, dingy-yellowish in age, soon soft and
spongy. Gills rather narrow, 7 mm. broad, sinuate-adnexed, whitish at first, then
pale cinnamon, crowded, edge serratulate and paler. Stem 6&ndash;8 cm. long, with a
slight bulb when young, from whose margin arises the dense partial veil; white
and very pruinate above the veil, which remains as dingy fibrils stained by the
spores; spongy and soft within, becoming somewhat hollow. Veil white with an
olive tinge. Spores, 10&ndash;12Ã—5.5&ndash;6.5Âµ, granular within, almost smooth. Odor agreeable.</p>

<p>Kauffman says this resembles C. herpeticus, except that the gills when young
are never violet-tinged.</p>

<p>I found this plant in Poke Hollow, near Chillicothe. It was unknown to me
and I sent it to Dr. Kauffman of Michigan University to determine. I found it
under beech trees, during October and November.</p>


<h3><i>Cortinarius varius. Fr.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Variable Cortinarius. Edible.</span></p>

<p><i>Varius&mdash;Variable</i>, so called because it varies in stature, its color and habit
are unchangeable. The pileus is about two inches broad; compact, hemispherical,
then expanded; regular, slightly viscid, thin margin at first incurved, sometimes
with fragments of the web-like veil adhering.</p>

<p>The gills are notched, thin, crowded, quite entire, purplish, at length clay-colored
or cinnamon.</p>

<p>The stem is solid, short, covered with threads, whitish, bulbous, from one and
a half to two and a half inches long.</p>

<p>The plant is quite variable in size but constant in color. It is found in woods.
I found specimens at Salem, Ohio, and at Bowling Green, Ohio. September to
November.</p>


<h3><i>Cortinarius cÃ¦rulescens. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>CÃ¦rulescens, azure-blue. Pileus fleshy, convex, expanded, even, viscid, azure-blue,
flesh soft, not changing color when bruised.</p>

<p>The gills are attached to the stem, slightly rounded behind, crowded, quite
entire, at first of a pure dark blue, then rusty from the spores.</p>

<p>The stem is solid, attenuated upward, firm, bright violet, becoming pale,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
whitish, bulb growing less with age, fibrillose from vein. Spores elliptical. Neither
the flesh nor the gills change color when bruised. This fact distinguishes it from
C. purpurascens. When young the entire plant is more or less blue, or bluish-purple,
and the color never entirely leaves the plant. In age it becomes somewhat
spotted with yellow. The flesh is a little tough and needs to be stewed for some
time. Found in Whinnery's woods, Salem, Ohio. September to October.</p>

elliptical, 12Ã—6Âµ. I found this
species in Tolerton's woods,
Salem, Ohio, St. John's woods,
Bowling Green, Ohio, also on
Ralston's Run near Chillicothe,
where the specimens in
Figure 235 were found. Both
cap and stem are covered with a thick gluten. They grow, with us, in woods
among leaves. The young plant has a development peculiar to itself. The cap
varies greatly in color. The flesh is white or whitish. The peculiar bluish-white
gills of the young plant will attract attention at once. It is found from September
to November.</p>

<p>The Violet Cortinarius is a very beautiful mushroom and one easy of recognition.
At first the whole plant is uniformly colored, but with age the gills assume
a dingy ochraceous or brownish-cinnamon hue. The cap is generally well formed
and regular, and is beautifully adorned with little hairy scales or tufts. These
are rarely shown in figures of the European plant, but they are quite noticeable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>

<h3><i>Cortinarius croceocolor. Kauff. sp. nov.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saffron-Colored Cortinarius. (Telamonia.)</span></p>

<p>Croceocolor means saffron-colored.</p>

<p>Pileus 3&ndash;7 cm. broad, convex then expanded, saffron-yellow, with dense,
dark-brown, erect squamules on disk; whole surface has a velvety appearance and

  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 246.</span>&mdash;Cortinarius evernius.</p>
</div>

<p>Evernius comes from a Greek word meaning sprouting well, flourishing.</p>

<p>The pileus is one to three inches broad, rather thin, between membranaceous
and fleshy, at first conical, becoming bell-shaped, and finally expanded, very
slightly umbonate, everywhere covered with silky, adpressed veil, usually purplish-bay
when smooth, brick-red when dry, then pale ochraceous when old, at length
cracked and torn into fibrils, very fragile, flesh thin and colored like the
pileus.</p>

<p>The gills are attached to the stem, quite broad, ventricose, somewhat distant,
purplish-violet, becoming pale, finally cinnamon.</p>

<p>The stem is three to five inches long, equal or attenuated downwards, often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
slightly striate, soft, violaceous, scaly from the remains of the white veil. The
spores are elliptical, granular, 10Ã—7Âµ.</p>

<p>They grow in damp pine woods. The specimens in the photograph were
gathered in Purgatory Swamp near Boston, and sent to me by Mrs. Blackford.
They are found in August and September.</p>

<p>Castaneus, a chestnut. The pileus one inch or more broad, at first quite small
and globose, with a delicate fibrillose veil, which makes the margin appear
silvery; dark-bay or dirty-violet, often with a tawny tint; soon expanded, broadly
umbonate, pileus often cracked on the margin and slightly upturned.</p>

<p>The gills are fixed, rather broad, somewhat crowded, violet-tinged, then
cinnamon-brown, ventricose. Spores, 8Ã—5Âµ.</p>

<p>The stem is one to three inches high, inclined to be cartilaginous, stuffed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
then hollow, even, lilac-tinged at the top, white or whitish below the veil, the
whole stem beautifully fibrillose, veil white.</p>

<p>This plant is very abundant on Cemetery Hill, growing under pine trees.
The caps are small, but they grow in such profusion that it would not be
difficult to secure enough for a meal. They compare very favorably with the
Fairy Ring mushroom in flavor. They have little or no odor. Found in
October and November.</p>

PURPLE-BROWN SPORED AGARICS.</h2>


<h3><i>Agaricus. Linn.</i> (<i>Psalliota. Fr.</i>)</h3>

<p>The pileus is fleshy, but the flesh of the stem is of different texture from that
of the pileus, veil universal, concrete with the cuticle of the pileus, and fixed
to the stem, forming a ring which soon disappears in some species; the stem
is readily separated from the cap and the gills are free from the stem or slightly
adnexed, white at first, then pink, afterwards purple-brown.</p>

<p>All the species grow in rich ground, and it includes many of our valuable
food mushrooms.</p>

  <p class="caption"> <span class="smcap">Figure 248.</span>&mdash;Agaricus campestris. Two-thirds natural size.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Campestris, from campus, a field.</i> This is perhaps the widest known of all
mushrooms, familiarly known as the "Pink-gilled mushroom." It is the species
found in the markets. It is the only species which is sure to respond to the
methods of cultivation.</p>

<p>It is the same species which is bought in cans at the store.</p>

<p>In very young plants the pileus is somewhat globular, as will be seen in the
small plants in the front row in Figure 248. The edge is connected with the
stem by the veil; then round convex, then expanding, becoming almost flat;
surface dry, downy, even, quite scaly, varying in color from creamy-white to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
light-brown; margin extending beyond the gills, as will be seen in Figure 249
in the one on the extreme right.</p>

<p>The gills, when first revealed by the separation of the veil, are of a delicate
pink hue, but with advancing age this generally deepens to a dark-brown or
blackish-brown color.</p>

<p>The stem is rather short, nearly equal, white or whitish; the substance in
the center is more spongy than the exterior, hence it is said to be stuffed. Sometimes
the collar shrivels so much that it is scarcely perceptible, and may disappear
altogether in old plants. The spores are brown in mass. The cap of this
mushroom is from three to four inches in diameter and the stem from one to
three inches long.</p>

<p>This is the first mushroom that yielded to cultivation. It is raised in large
quantities, not only in this country, but especially in France, Japan, and China.
No doubt other species and genera will be produced in time.</p>

<p>This species grows in grassy places, in pastures, and richly manured grounds,
never in the woods. I found it in great abundance in Wood County, in fields
which had never been plowed and where the ground was unusually rich. There it
seemed to grow in groups or large clusters. Usually it is found singly. Found
from August to October. The plants figured here were found near Chillicothe.</p>

  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 250.</span>&mdash;Agaricus rodmani. Two-thirds natural size.</p>
</div>

<p>The pileus is creamy, with brownish spots, firm, surface dry. The mature
specimens frequently have the surface of the cap broken into large, brownish
scales.</p>

<p>The gills are whitish, then pink, becoming dark-brown; narrow, close and
unequal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>

<p>The stem is fleshy, solid, short, thick, about two inches long. The collar
when well developed exhibits a striking characteristic. It appears as if there were
two collars with a space between them. Its spores are broadly elliptical, .0002 to
.00025 inch long.</p>

<p>It may be easily distinguished from the common Agaric by the time when
found, its thick firm flesh, its narrow gills, which are almost white at first, and
its double collar. I have found people eating it, supposing they were eating the
common mushroom.</p>

<p>It is found in grassy places and especially between the cobble stones along
the gutters in the cities. The specimens in Figure 250 were found in Chillicothe
in the gutters. It is a meaty plant and one can soon tell it from its weight alone.
It is found through May and June. It is fully as good to eat as the common
mushroom. Macadam speaks of finding it in the fall, but I have never succeeded
in finding it later than June.</p>

<p>Silvicola, from silva, woods and colo, to inhabit. The pileus is convex,
sometimes expanded or nearly plane, smooth, shining, white or yellowish.</p>

<p>The gills are crowded, thin, free, rounded behind, generally narrowed toward
each end, at first white, then pinkish, finally blackish-brown.</p>

<p>The stem is long, cylindrical, stuffed or hollow, white, bulbous; ring either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
thick or thin, entire or lacerated. Spores elliptical, 6&ndash;8Ã—4&ndash;5. The plant is four
to six inches high. Pileus three to six inches broad. <i>Peck.</i> 36th N. Y. State Bot.</p>

<p>A. silvicola is very closely related to the common mushroom. Its chief
differences are in its place of
growth, its being slender, and its
hollow stem somewhat bulbous at
the base. I have found it many
times in the woods about Chillicothe,
although I have never succeeded
in finding more than one
or two at a time. I have always
put them with edible species and
have eaten them when thus
cooked with others.</p>

<p>Because of the resemblance
which it bears, in its earlier
stages, to the deadly Amanita,
one can not exercise too great
care in identifying it. It grows
in the woods and is found from
July to October.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Arvensis, pertaining to a field.</i> Pileus is smooth, white or yellowish, convex
or conical, bell-shaped, then expanded, more or less mealy. The gills are crowded,
free, generally broader toward the stem; at first whitish, then pinkish, finally
black-brown.</p>

<p>The stem is stout, equal, slightly thickened at the base, smooth, hollow or
stuffed, ring rather large and thick, the upper part membranaceous and white,
while the lower or exterior surface is thicker, downy, radically split and yellowish.</p>

<p>The spores are elliptical, .0003 to .0004 inch long.</p>

<p>This plant grows much larger than the common mushroom, and may be
distinguished by the collar being composed of two parts closely allied to each
other making a double membrane, the lower part being much thicker, softer in
texture and split in a stellate manner into broad and yellow rays, as will be seen
in Figure 252.</p>

<p>I found it very plentiful in Wood County, Ohio, and in quantities in
Dr. Manville's yard in Bowling Green, Ohio. I ate them frequently and gave
them to my friends, who all voted them delicious.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<p>When the stem is first cut
there exudes from the wound
a yellowish liquid which is
quite a sure ear mark of this
species.</p>

<p>There is a tradition that the
spores will not germinate unless
they pass through the
alimentary canal of the horse
or some animal. However this
may be, it is found frequently
where no trace of the horse
can be found. It appears
from July to September. I
have found it in Fayette County,
Ohio, in large rings, resembling
the Fairy-Ring
Mushroom, only the ring is
very large, as well as the
mushrooms.</p>

</div>

<p>Abruptus means to break
away, referring to the breaking
of the veil from the margin
of the cap.</p>

<p>The pileus is creamy-white,
dry and silky, quite irregular
in shape when young, turning
yellow when bruised or when
the stem is cut.</p>

<p>The gills are slightly pinkish
when the veil first breaks, gradually growing a deeper pink, in mature specimens
becoming brownish, soft, free from the stem, quite close, unequal.</p>

<p>The stem is creamy-white, much darker toward the base, hollow, rather stiff,
quite brittle, frequently found to be split lengthwise, ventricose, tapering toward
the cap.</p>

<p>The veil is rather frail, one portion of it often adhering to the cap and another
portion forming a ring on the stem.</p>

<p>Through the courtesy of Captain McIlvaine I am able to present an excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 312]<br />[Pg 313]</a></span>
picture of this species. The beginner will have some trouble to distinguish it
from A. silvicola. This species, like the A. silvicola, is closely related to the
meadow mushroom, but can be readily separated from it. This, too, like the
A. silvicola, when seen in the woods at a distance, resembles the Amanita, but a
careful glance at the gills will detect the difference.</p>

<p>The gills of the very young plant may appear white, but they will soon develop
a pinkish tinge which will distinguish it from the Amanita. It is found in thin
woods from July to October.</p>


<h3><i>Agaricus comptulus. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Comptulus means beautified or luxuriously decked; so called from the silky
lustre of its cap.</p>

<p>The pileus is at first convex, then expanded, rather fleshy, thinner at the
margin and incurved, usually with an adpressed silky finish to the surface of the
cap which gives rise to its specific name.</p>

<p>The gills are free, much rounded toward the margin and the stem, white at
first, then grayish, pinkish, purple-brown in old plants.</p>

<p>The stem is hollow, tapering from the base to the cap, slight bulbous, white,
then yellowish, fleshy, fibrous. The veil is more delicate than in A. silvaticus,
parts of it often found in young plants on the margin of the cap, forming a ring
on the stem which soon almost disappears. Spores small, 4&ndash;5Ã—2&ndash;3Âµ.</p>

<p>The surface of the cap, the rounding of the gills both in front and behind,
also the tendency to turn white paper blue or bluish when the flesh of the cap
comes in contact with it, will assist in determining this species.</p>

<p>It is found in grassy places in open woods, especially in the vicinity of pine
trees, October and November.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>

<p>Placomyces means a flat
mushroom. This is one of
our prettiest plants.</p>

<p>The pileus is broadly
ovate, rather thin, at first
convex, but when it is fully
expanded it is quite flat,
whitish, brown in the center,
as will be seen in Figure
256, but it is covered with
a persistent brown scale.</p>

<p>The gills are white at
first, then pink, turning
blackish brown, quite
crowded.</p>

<p>The stem is rather long,
and slender, cylindrical
stuffed, somewhat bulbous
at the base, commonly
whitish but at times bears
yellow stains toward the
base, tapering toward the
cap. The veil is quite interesting.
It is broad and
double, loosely joined together
by threads, the
lower or outer veil breaking
first into regular radiating
portions. The spores
are elliptical, 5&ndash;6.5Âµ long.
The caps are two to four
inches broad and the stem
is three to five inches long.</p>

<p>They are found in lawns
or in thin woods. They are
much more abundant in
hemlock woods though
they are frequently found
in mixed woods in which
there are hemlock trees.
The behavior of the veil
is very similar to A. arven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>sis
and A. silvicola and indeed
this plant seems to be
very closely related to these
species. It is found from
July to September.</p>


<h3><i>Agaricus cretaceus. Fr.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Chalk Agaric.

<p>The gills are free, remote,
quite ventricose, narrowed

become brownish. Spores,
5&ndash;6Ã—3.5Âµ.</p>

<p>The stem is two to three
inches long, even, smooth,
firm, tapering toward the
cap, hollow, or stuffed
with a fine pith, white.</p>

<p>It is found on lawns
and in rich places. I find
it more frequently in rich

a rare dish. Found in
August and September.</p>


<h3><i>Agaricus subrufescens. Pk.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Slightly Red Mushroom. Edible.</span></p>

<p>Subrufescens, sub, under; rufescens, becoming red. The pileus is at first

and minutely or obscurely scaly, whitish, grayish, or dull reddish-brown,
usually smooth and darker on the disk. Flesh white and unchangeable.</p>

<p>The gills are at first white or whitish, then pink, finally blackish-brown.</p>

<p>The stem is rather long, often somewhat thickened or bulbous at the base, at
first stuffed, then hollow, white, the ring is scaly on the under side, mycelium
whitish, forming slender branching root-like strings. The spores are elliptical.
<i>Peck</i>, 48th Rep. N. Y. State Bot.</p>

<p>The reddish-brown color is due to the coating of fibrils that covers the cap.
In the center it does not separate into scales, hence it is smoother and more distinctly
reddish-brown than the rest. Its veil resembles that of the A. placomyces,
but instead of the lower surface breaking into radial portions it breaks into small
floccose flakes or scales.</p>

<p>This species is found about greenhouses, and is frequently found in large
clusters.</p>

<p>Dr. McIlvaine says: "This species is now cultivated and has manifest advantages
over the market species&mdash;it is easier to cultivate, very productive, produces
in less time after planting the spawn, is free from attacks of insects,
carries better and keeps longer."</p>

  Showing the globose caps, narrow gills, solid stem, and the peculiar incurved margin. Natural size.</p>
</div>

<p>Halophilus is from two Greek words meaning sea and loving, or fond of.</p>

<p>This is a large fleshy plant and does not readily decay. At first it is quite
round, then becomes broadly convex. All specimens that I have examined were
covered with adpressed scales of a reddish-brown color, becoming grayish-brown
when old. The flesh is white, becoming pink or reddish when cut. The margin
has a peculiar angular turn, often retaining portions of the rather fragile
veil.</p>

<p>The taste is pleasant, and the odor is distinctly that of the seashore.</p>

<p>The gills are quite narrow, as will be seen in Figure 258, much crowded,
free, pinkish at first, becoming purplish-brown as the plant matures. The edge
of the gills is whitish.</p>

<p>The stem is short, stout, solid, firm, equal, or occasionally slightly bulbous.
The ring is rather delicate and in older specimens it is frequently wanting. The
spores are broadly elliptical and purplish-brown, 7&ndash;8Ã—5&ndash;6Âµ.</p>

<p>The specimens in figure 258 were sent to me from Boston, Mass., by Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 318]<br />[Pg 319]</a></span>
Blackford, and on opening the box the odor of the seashore was plainly noticed.
The flesh when cut quickly turned to a pinkish or reddish hue and the water in
which the plants were prepared for cooking was changed to a faintly pink tinge.
These plants were sent me the first of June, but the stems were free from worms
and were as easily cooked as the caps. I regard it as one of the very best mushrooms
for table use, while also easy to distinguish.</p>

<p>It seems to delight in sandy soil near salt water. This was formerly called
Agaricus maritimus.</p>


<h3><i>Pilosace. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Pilosace is from two Greek words, <i>pilos</i>, felt; <i>sakos</i>, garment.</p>

<p>Hymenophore is distinct from the stem. Gills are free, and at first remote,
from the stem. The general and partial veil are both absent, hence it is without
ring or volva. This genus seems to have the habit of Agaricus but no ring.</p>

</div>

<p>Eximia means choice, distinguished.</p>

<p>The pileus is fleshy, thin, convex or broadly campanulate, at length expanded
and subumbonate, smooth, dark sooty-brown.</p>

<p>The gills are close, broad, ventricose, rounded behind, free, dull-red, or
brownish-pink, then brown.</p>

<p>The stem is slender, hollow, a little thicker at the base, dull-red. The spores
are elliptical, .004 inch long.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>

<p>These plants are small and quite rare, yet I have found the plants in
Haynes' Hollow on three different occasions. Dr. Peck writes that it is a very
rare plant. It grows on old stumps and decayed logs. The plants in figure <ins title="Figure number missing in original.">259</ins>
were found in Haynes' Hollow and photographed by Dr. Kellerman.</p>


<h3><i>Stropharia. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Stropharia is from the Greek, strophos, a sword belt. The spores are bright
purple-brown, brown or slate color. The flesh of the stem and the pileus is
continuous. The veil, when ruptured, forms a ring on the stem. The gills
are rounded and are
not free.</p>

<p>The genus can be distinguished
from all the
genera of the purple-spored
plants except
the Agarics by the presence
of a ring and by
the united flesh of the
stem and the cap and
by the attachment of
the gills. They grow
on the ground or are
elliptical.</p>

<p>Semiglobata&mdash;semi,
half; globus, a ball.
The pileus is somewhat
fleshy at the center, thin
at the margin, hemispherical,
not expanded,
even, viscid when
moist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>

<p>The stem is hollow, slender, straight, smooth, glutinous, yellowish, veil
abrupt.</p>

<p>The gills are firmly attached to the stem, broad, plane, sometimes inclined to
be ventricose, clouded with black.</p>

<p>This plant is very common on the Dunn farm on the Columbus Pike, north
of Chillicothe, but is found everywhere in grassy places recently manured, or
on dung.</p>

<p>This plant has been under the ban for a number of years, but like many
others its bad reputation has been outlived. Found from May to November.</p>

  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure</span> 261.&mdash;Stropharia Hardii.</p>
</div>

<p>Hardii is named for the collector and author of this book.</p>

<p>Plant 10 cm. high; pileus 9 cm. broad; stem 1Â½ cm. thick.</p>

<p>Pileus pale bright ochraceous; gills brownish, near Prout's brown (R); stem
pale-yellow tinge.</p>

<p>Pileus convex to expanded, thick at the center, thin toward the margin,
smooth; flesh tinged yellow.</p>

<p>Gills subelliptical to subventricose behind, broadly emarginate, adnexed.
Basidia 4-spored. Spores suboblong, smooth, 5&ndash;9Ã—3&ndash;5Âµ, purple-brown under the
microscope.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<p>Cystidia not very numerous on side of gills, varying from clavate to subventricose
and sublanceolate, the free end more or less irregular when narrow,
rarely branching below the apex, and usually with a prominent broad apiculus or
with two or several short processes. Similar cells on edge of gills, but somewhat
smaller and more regular.</p>

<p>Stem even at the base, tapering to a short root, transversely floccose, scaly
both above and below the ring. The ring membranaceous, not prominent but
still evident, about 2 cm. from the apex. <i>Atkinson.</i></p>

<p>The specimens in Figure 261 are very old plants. While the plant was in
season I did not photograph it, but when Prof. Atkinson named it I hastened to
find some good specimens but only two had survived sufficiently to photograph.
They were found October 15, 1906, on Mr. Miller's farm in Poke Hollow near
Chillicothe.</p>


<h3><i>Stropharia stercoraria. Fr.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Dung Stropharia. Edible.</span></p>

<p>Stercoraria is from stercus, dung. The pileus is slightly fleshy at the center
but thin at the margin; hemispherical, then expanded, even, smooth, discoid,
slightly striate on the margin.</p>

<p>The gills are firmly attached to the stem, slightly crowded, broad, white,
umber, then olive-black.</p>

<p>The stem is three inches or more long, stuffed with a fibrous pith, equal, ring
close to cap, flocculose below the ring, viscid when moist, yellowish.</p>

<p>This species is distinguished from the S. semiglobata by the distinct pithy
substance with which the stem is stuffed, also by the fact that the cap is never
fully expanded. It is found on dung and manure piles, in richly manured fields,
and sometimes in woods.</p>


<h3><i>Stropharia Ã¦ruginosa. Curt.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Green Stropharia.</span></p>

<p>Ã†ruginosa is from Ã¦rugo, verdigris. The pileus is fleshy, plano-convex, subumbonate,
clothed with a green evanescent slime, becoming paler as the slime
disappears.</p>

<p>The gills are firmly attached to the stem, soft, brown, tinged with purple,
slightly ventricose, not crowded.</p>

<p>The stem is hollow, equal, fibrillose or squamose below the ring, tinged
with blue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>

<p>This species is quite variable in form and color. The most typical forms are
found in the fall, in very wet weather and in shady woods. This is one of the
species from which the ban has not been removed but its appearance will lead
no one to care to cultivate its acquaintance further than name it. It is claimed
by most writers that it is poisonous. Found in meadows and woods, from July
to November.</p>


<h3><i>Hypholoma. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Hypholoma is from two Greek words, meaning a web and a fringe, referring
to the web-like veil which frequently adheres to the margin of the cap, not forming
a ring on the stem and not always apparent on old specimens.</p>

<p>The pileus is fleshy, margin at first incurved. The gills are attached to the
stem, sometimes notched at the stem. The stem is fleshy, similar in substance to
the cap.</p>

<p>They grow mostly in thick clusters on wood either above or under the ground.
The spores are brown-purple, almost black.</p>

<p>This genus differs from the genus Agaricus from the fact that its gills are
attached to the stem and its stem is destitute of a ring.</p>

</div>

<p>Incertum, uncertain. Prof. Peck, who named this species, was uncertain
whether it was not a form of H. candolleanum, to which it seemed to be very
closely related; but as the gills of that plant are at first violaceous and of this one
white at first, he concluded to risk the uncertainty on a new species.</p>

<p>The pileus is thin, ovate, broadly spreading, fragile, whitish, margin often
wavy and often adorned with fragments of the woolly white veil, opaque when
dry, transparent when moist.</p>

<p>The gills are thin, narrow, close, fastened to the stem at their inner extremity,
white at first, then purplish-brown, edges often uneven.</p>

<p>The stem is equal, straight, hollow, white, slender, at least one to three inches
long. The spores are purplish-brown and elliptical. It is found in lawns,
gardens, pastures, and thin woods. It is small but grows in such profusion that
one can obtain quantities of it. The caps are very tender and delicious. It appears
as early as May.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>Hypholoma appendiculatum. Bull.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Appendiculate Hypholoma. Edible.</span></p>

<p>Appendiculatum, a small appendage. This is so called from the fragments
of the veil adhering to the margin of the cap.</p>

<p>The pileus is thin, ovate, expanded, watery, when dry, covered with dry
atoms; margin thin and often split, with a white veil; the color when moist dark-brown,
when dry nearly white, often with floccose scales on the cap.</p>

<p>The gills are firmly attached to the stem, crowded, white, then rosy-brown,
and at length dingy-brown.</p>

<p>The stem is hollow, smooth, equal, white, fibrous, mealy at the apex. The
veil is very delicate and only seen in quite young plants.</p>

<p>The plant grows in the spring and the summer and is found on stumps and
sometimes on lawns. It is a favorite mushroom with those who know it. The
plant can be dried for winter use and retains its flavor to a remarkable degree.</p>

<p>Hypholoma candolleanum, Fr., resembles the H. appendiculatum in many
features, but the gills are violaceous, becoming cinnamon-brown and in old plants
nearly free from the stem. It
has more substance. The caps,
however, are very tender and
delicious. Found in clusters.</p>

<p>Lachrymabundum&mdash;full of
tears. This plant is so called because
in the morning or in damp
weather the edge of the gills retain
very minute drops of water.
The plant in Figure 263 was
photographed in the afternoon
yet there can be seen a number
of these minute drops.</p>

<p>The pileus is fleshy, campanulate,
then convex, sometimes
broadly umbonate, spotted with
hairy scales; flesh white.</p>

<p>The gills are closely attached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
to the stem, notched, crowded,
somewhat ventricose, unequal,
whitish, then brown-purple, distilling
minute drops of dew in
wet weather or in the morning.</p>

<p>The stem is hollow, somewhat
thickened at the base, quite scaly
with fibrils, often becoming
brownish-red, two to three inches
long. The spores are brownish-purple.</p>

<p>I have never found the plant
elsewhere than on the Chillicothe
high school lawn, and then not in
sufficient numbers to test its edible
qualities. When I do, I shall
try it cautiously, but with full
faith that I shall be permitted to
try others. Found on the
ground and on decayed wood. It
often grows in clusters. September
to October.</p>

<p><i>Sublateritium is from sub, under, and later, a brick.</i> The pileus is brick-red,
with pale yellowish border; the surface is covered with fine silky fibres; fleshy,
moist, and firm; the cap is from two to four inches broad; remnants of the veil
are often seen on the margin; flesh creamy, firm, and bitter.</p>

<p>The gills are creamy when young, olive when old; attached to the stem at
inner extremity, rather narrow, crowded, and unequal.</p>

<p>The stem is creamy when young, lower part slightly tinged with red, hollow
or stuffed, having silky fibres on the surface, two to four inches long, often
incurved because of position. The spores are sooty-brown and elliptical.</p>

<p>It grows in large clusters around old stumps. It is especially plentiful about
Chillicothe. It is not equal to many others of the Hypholomas as an esculent.
Sometimes it is bitter even after it is cooked. Captain McIlvaine gives a plausible
reason when he says it may be due to the passage of larvÃ¦ through the flesh of the
plant. It is found from September to early winter.</p>

</div>

<p>Perplexum means perplexing; so called because it is quite difficult to distinguish
it from H. sublateritium, also from H. fascicularis. From the latter
it may be known by its redder cap, its whitish flesh, purple-brown tint of the
mature gills and mild flavor. Its smaller size, the greenish and purplish tint of
the gills, and the slender hollow stem will aid in distinguishing it from H.
perplexum.</p>

<p>The pileus is complex, fleshy, expanded, smooth, sometimes broadly and
slightly umbonate, brown with a pale-yellow margin, disk sometimes
reddish.</p>

<p>The gills are rounded, notched, easily separating from the stem, pale-yellow,
greenish ash-color, finally purplish-brown, thin, quite close.</p>

<p>The stem is nearly equal, firm, hollow, slightly fibrillose, yellowish or whitish
above and reddish-brown below. The spores are elliptical and purplish
brown.</p>

<p>This plant is very abundant in Ohio. It grows about old stumps, but a
favorite habitat seems to be upon old sawdust piles. I have found it after we have
had considerable freezing weather. The plants in the figure were frozen when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
I found them, the 27th of November. Dr. McIlvaine says in his book, "If the collector
gets puzzled, as he will, over one or all of these species, because no
description fits, he can whet his patience and his appetite by calling it H. perplexum
and graciously eating it."</p>


<h3><i>Psilocybe. Pers.</i></h3>

<p><i>Psilocybe is from two Greek words, naked and head.</i> The spores are purple-brown

<p>The gills are rounded behind, attached to stem, easily separating from it,
narrow, dry, crowded, white, then rosy-brown or flesh-color.</p>

<p>The stem is hollow, tough, pallid, equal, smooth, one to two inches long.

<p>The stem is soft, rather short, hollow, lower half clavate and sunk into the
sand, striate. The spores are 12Ã—8.</p>

<p>They are found in August and September. They delight in sandy soil, as the
specific name indicates. The plants in the photograph were found near Columbus
and photographed by Dr. Kellerman. It is quite common in sandy soil. I do
not think it is edible. I should advise great caution in its use.</p>

THE BLACK-SPORED AGARICS.</h2>


<p>The genera belonging to this series have black spores. There is an entire
absence of purple or brown shades. The genus Gomphidius, placed in this
series for other reasons, has dingy-olivaceous spores.</p>


<h3><i>Coprinus. Pers.</i></h3>

<p>Coprinus is from a Greek word meaning dung. This genus can be readily
recognized from the black spores and from the deliquescence of the gills and cap
into an inky substance. Many of the species grow in dung, as the name implies,
or on recently manured ground. Some grow in flat rich ground, or where there
has been a fill, or on dumping grounds; some grow on wood and around old
stumps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>

<p>The pileus separates easily from the stem. The gills are membranaceous,
closely pressed together. The spores, with few exceptions, are black. Most of
the species are edible, but many are of such small size that they are easily overlooked.</p>

<p>Comatus is from coma, having long hair, shaggy. It is so called from a
fancied resemblance to a wig on a barber's block. A description is hardly
necessary with a photograph before us. They always remind us of a congregation
of goose eggs standing on end. This plant cannot be confounded with any other,
and the finder is the happy possessor of a rich, savory morsel that cannot be
duplicated in any market.</p>

<p>The pileus is fleshy, moist, at first egg-shaped, cylindrical, becoming bell-shaped,
seldom expanded, splitting at the margin along the line of the gills, adorned
with scattered yellowish scales, tinged with purplish-black, yet sometimes entirely
white; surface shaggy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p>

<p>The gills are free, crowded, equal, creamy white, becoming pink, brown, then
black, and dripping an inky fluid.</p>

<p>The stem is three to eight inches long, hollow, smooth, or slightly fibrillose,
tapering upward, creamy-white, brittle, easily separating from the cap, slightly
bulbous at the base. The ring is rarely adherent or movable in young plants, later
lying on the ground at the base of the stem or disappearing altogether. The
spores are black and elliptical, and are shed in liquid drops.</p>

<p>Found in damp rich ground, gardens, rich lawns, barnyards, and dumping
grounds. They often grow in large clusters. They are found everywhere in
great abundance, from May till late frost. A weak stomach can digest any of
the Coprini when almost any other food will give it trouble. I am always pleased
to give a dish of any Coprini to an invalid.</p>

</div>

<p>Micaceus is from <i>micare</i>, to glisten, and refers to the small scales on the
pileus which resemble mica scales. The pileus is tawny-yellow, tan or light buff,
ovate, bell-shaped; having striations radiating from near the center of the disk
to the margin; glistening mica-like scales covering undisturbed young specimens;
the margin somewhat revolute or wavy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span></p>

<p>The gills are crowded, rather narrow, whitish, then tinged with pinkish or
purplish-brown then black.</p>

<p>The stem is slender, fragile, hollow, silky, even, whitish, often twisted, one
to three inches long. The spores are blackish, sometimes brown, elliptical, 10Ã—5Âµ.</p>

<p>The Glistening Coprinus is a small but common and beautiful species. One
cannot fail to recognize a Coprinus from a photograph. It is somewhat bell-shaped
and marked with impressed lines or striations from the margin to or beyond
the center of the disk and sprinkled with fugacious micaceous granules all of
which show in Figure 273. For eating, this is without doubt the best mushroom
that grows. The specimens in Figure 273 grew around an old peach stump in
Dr. Miesse's yard, in Chillicothe. You will find them around any stump, especially
just before a rain. If you secure a good supply and wish to keep them, partially
cook them and warm them for use.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Ebulbosus</i>, without being bulbous. This seems to be the difference between
the American and the European plants, the latter being bulbous.</p>

<p>The pileus is membranaceous, at first ovate, bell-shaped, striate, variegated
with broad white scales, or white patches; one to two inches broad.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span></p>

<p>The gills are free, broad, ventricose, grayish-black, soon deliquescing.</p>

<p>The stem is hollow, equal, fragile, smooth, four to five inches long.</p>

<p>Usually found where old stumps have been cut off under the ground, leaving
the roots in the ground. It is very abundant. The collector will have no trouble
to recognize it from Figure 274. They are found from June to October. Edible,
but not as good as C. atramentarius.</p>


<h3><i>Coprinus ephemerus. Fr.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Ephemeral Coprinus. Edible.</span></p>

<p>Ephemerus, lasting for a day. This plant lasts only for a short time. It
comes up in the early morning or at night and as soon as the sun's rays touch
it it deliquesces into an inky fluid.</p>

<p>The pileus is membranaceous, very thin, oval, slightly covered with bran-like
scales, disk elevated, even.</p>

<p>Gills are adnexed, distant, whitish, brown, then black. The stem is slender,
equal, pellucid, smooth, from one to two inches high.</p>

<p>When this plant is fully developed it is quite a beautiful specimen, striated
from margin to center. Found on dung and dung heaps and in well manured
grass plots from May to October. It must be cooked at once. Its chief value
is its excellent mushroom flavor.</p>


<h3><i>Coprinus ovatus. Fr.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Ovate Coprinus. Edible.</span></p>

<p><i>Ovatus is from ovum</i>, an egg. It is so called from the shape of the pileus,
which is somewhat membranaceous, ovate, then expanded, striate; at first woven
into densely imbricated, thick, concentric scales; is bulbous, rooting, flocculose,
hollow above, the ring deciduous; gills free, remote, slightly ventricose, for
sometime white, then umber-blackish.</p>

<p>This plant is much smaller and less striking than the C. comatus, yet its edible
qualities are the same. I have eaten it and found it delicious. It is found
in about the same locality in which you would expect to find the C. comatus.</p>

<p><i>Fimetarius is from fimetum, a dunghill.</i> The pileus is somewhat membranaceous,
clavate, then conical, at length torn and revolute; at first rough with
floccose scales, then naked; longitudinally cracked and furrowed, even at the apex.
The stem is inclined to be scaly, thickened at the base, solid. The gills are free,
reaching the stem, at first ventricose, then linear, brownish-black. <i>Fries.</i></p>

<p>This is quite a variable plant. There are a number of varieties classed
under this species. It is said to be of excellent flavor. I have never eaten it.</p>


<h3><i>PanÃ¦olus. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>PanÃ¦olus is from two Greek words, all; variegated. This genus is so called
from the mottled appearance of the gills. The pileus is somewhat fleshy, margin
even, but never striate. The margin always extends beyond the gills and the
gills are not uniform in color. The mottled appearance of the gills is due to the
falling of the black spores. The gills do not deliquesce.</p>

<p>The stem is smooth, sometimes scaly, at times quite long, hollow. The veil,
when present, is interwoven.</p>

<p>This plant is found on rich lawns recently manured, but principally on dung.</p>

<p>There are only two edible species, P. retirugis and P. solidipes. The other
species would not be likely to attract the attention of the ordinary collector.</p>

Natural size, showing portions of the veil on the margin.</p>
</div>

<p>Retirugis is from rete, a net; ruga, a wrinkle. The pileus is about one inch
in diameter, inclined to be globose, then hemispherical, slightly umbonate, center
darker, with united raised ribs, sometimes sprinkled with opaque atoms; veil torn,
appendiculate.</p>

<p>The gills are fixed, ascending, broad in middle; and in the expanded forms
the gills are separated more and more from the stem and finally appear more or
less triangular; cinereous-black, frequently somewhat clouded.</p>

<p>The stem is equal, covered with a frost-like bloom, cylindrical, sometimes
tortuous, cartilaginous, becoming hollow, pinkish-purple, always darker below and
paler above, bulbous.</p>

<p>The veil in young and unexpanded plants is quite strong and prominent;
as the stem elongates it loosens from the stem, and as the cap expands it breaks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 340]<br />[Pg 341]</a></span>
into segments, frequently hanging to the margin of the cap. By close observation
one will sometimes detect a black band on the stem, caused by the falling of the
black spores, when the plant is damp, before the pileus has separated from the
stem. The spores are black and elliptical.</p>

<p>I have found it a number of times on the Chillicothe high school lawn, especially
after it was fertilized in the winter. It is found mostly on dung from June to
October. I do not recommend it as a delicacy.</p>

</div>

<p>Epimyces is from <i>epi</i>, upon; <i>myces</i>, a mushroom; so called because it is
parasitic on fungi. There are a number of species of mushrooms whose habitat
is on other mushrooms or fungus growths; such as Collybia cirrhata, C. racemosa,
C. tuberosa, Volvaria loveiana and the species of Nyctalis.</p>

<p>The pileus is fleshy, at first subglobose, then convex, white, silky, fibrillose,
flesh white or whitish, soft.</p>

<p>The gills are rather broad, somewhat close, rounded behind, adnexed, dingy-white,
becoming brown or blackish, with a white edge.</p>

<p>The stem is short, stout, tapering upwards, strongly striate and minutely
mealy or pruinose; solid in the young plant, hollow in the mature, but with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
cavity small; hairy, or substrigose at the base. The spores elliptical and black,
.0003 to .00035 of an inch long, .0002 to .00025 broad. <i>Peck.</i></p>

<p>The plants are small, about two thirds to an inch broad and from an inch to
an inch and a half high. It is referred to this genus because of its black spores.
It has other characteristics which would seem to place it better among Hypholomas.
It is not common. Found in October and November. The specimens in Figure
277 were found in Michigan and photographed by Dr. Fisher.</p>


<h3><i>PanÃ¦olus campanulatus. Linn.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Bell-Shaped Panaeolus.</span></p>

<p>Campanulatus is from <i>campanula</i>, a little bell.</p>

<p>The pileus is an inch to an inch and a quarter broad, oval or bell-shaped,
sometimes slightly umbonate, smooth, somewhat shining, grayish-brown, sometimes
becoming reddish-tinted, the margin often fringed with fragments of the veil.</p>

<p>The gills are attached, not broad, ascending, variegated with gray and black.</p>

<p>The stem is three to five inches long, hollow, slender, firm, straight, often
covered with frost-like bloom and often striate at the top, the veil remaining only
a short time. The spores are subellipsoid, 8&ndash;9Ã—6Âµ.</p>

<p>The gills do not deliquesce. It is widely distributed and is found in almost
any horse pasture.</p>

<p>Captain McIlvaine says in his book that he has eaten it in small quantities,
because larger could not be obtained, and with no other than pleasant effect. I
have found it about Chillicothe quite frequently but have never eaten it. It is
found from June to August.</p>


<h3><i>PanÃ¦olus fimicolus. Fr.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Dung Panaeolus.</span></p>

<p>Fimicolus is from fimus, dung; colo, to inhabit. The pileus somewhat fleshy,
convex-bell-shaped, obtuse, smooth, opaque; marked near the margin with a
narrow brown zone; the stem is fragile, elongated, equal, pallid, covered with
frost-like bloom above; the gills are firmly attached to the stem, broad, variegated
with gray and brown. <i>Fries.</i></p>

<p>The plant is very small and unimportant. It is found on dung, as its name
indicates, from June to September. The caps appear lighter in color when dry
than when wet.</p>

</div>

<p>Solidipes is from solidus, solid; pes, foot; and is so called because the stem
of the plant is solid. The pileus is two to three inches across; firm; at first hemispherical,
then subcampanulate or convex; smooth; white; the cuticle at length
breaking up into dingy-yellowish, rather large, angular scales. The gills are broad,
slightly attached, whitish, becoming black. The stem is five to eight inches long
and two to four lines thick, firm, smooth, white, solid, slightly striate at the
top. The spores are very black with a bluish tint. <i>Peck.</i> 23d Rep. N. Y.
State Bot.</p>

<p>This is a large and beautiful plant and easily distinguished because of its solid
stem, growing on dung. Sometimes minute drops of moisture will be seen on the
upper part of the stem. The plant is said to be one of the best of mushrooms
to eat.</p>

<p>Papilionaceus is from <i>papilio</i>, a butterfly.</p>

<p>The pileus is about an inch broad, somewhat fleshy, at first hemispherical,
sometimes subumbonate, the cuticle breaking up into scales when dry, as will be
seen in the photograph, pale-gray with a tinge of reddish-yellow especially on the
disk, sometimes smooth.</p>

<p>The gills are broadly attached to the stem, quite wide, at length plane, blackish
or with varying tints of black.</p>

<p>The stem is three to four inches long, slender, firm, equal, hollow, powdered
above, whitish, sometimes tinged with red or yellow, slightly striate at the top,
as will be seen in the photograph with a glass, generally stained with the
spores.</p>

<p>The specimens in Figure 279 were found in a garden that had been strongly
manured. It is usually found on dung and on grassy lawns during May and
June. Captain McIlvaine in his book speaks of this mushroom producing hilarity
or a mild form of intoxication. I should advise against its use.</p>


<h3><i>Anellaria. Karst.</i></h3>

<p>Anellaria is from <i>anellus</i>, a little ring. This genus is so called because of
the presence of a ring on the stem.</p>

<p>The pileus is somewhat fleshy, smooth, and even. The gills are adnexed,
dark slate-colored, variegated with black spores. The stem is central, smooth, firm,
shining, ring persistent or forming a zone around the stem.</p>


<h3><i>Anellaria separata. Karst.</i></h3>

<p>Separata means separate or distinct.</p>

<p>The pileus is somewhat fleshy, bell-shaped, obtuse, even, viscid, at first
ochraceous, then dingy-white, shining, smooth, wrinkled when old.</p>

<p>The gills are firmly attached to the stem, broad, ventricose, thin, crowded,
clouded, cinereous, margin nearly white, slightly deliquescent.</p>

<p>The stem is long, straight, shining, white, thickened downward, ring distant,
top somewhat striate, bulbous at the base. The spores are broadly elliptic-fusiform,
black, opaque, 10Ã—7Âµ.</p>

<p>It is found on dung from May to October. It is not poisonous.</p>


<h3><i>Bolbitius. Fr.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span></h3>

<p>Bolbitius is from a Greek word meaning cow-dung, referring to its place of
growth.</p>

<p>The pileus is membranaceous, yellow, becoming moist; gills moist but not
deliquescing, finally losing their color and becoming powdery; stem hollow and
confluent with the hymenophore. As the generic name implies the plant usually
grows on dung, but sometimes it is found growing on leaves and where the ground
had been manured the year before. The spores are of a rusty-red color.</p>


<h3><i>Bolbitius fragilis. (L.) Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Fragilis means fragile.</p>

<p>The pileus is membranaceous, yellow, then whitish, viscid, margin striate,
disk somewhat umbonate.</p>

<p>The gills are attenuated, adnexed, nearly free, ventricose, yellowish, then pale
cinnamon.</p>

<p>The stem is two to three inches long, naked, smooth, yellow. The spores are
rust-colored, 7Ã—3.5, Massee. 14&ndash;15Ã—8&ndash;9Âµ. Saccardo.</p>

<p>This species is much more delicate and fragile than B. Boltoni. I find it often
in dairy pastures. It is well flavored and cooks readily. Found from June to
October.</p>


<h3><i>Bolbitius Boltoni. Fr.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Bolton's Bolbitius. Edible.</span></p>

<p>The pileus is somewhat fleshy, viscid, at first smooth, then the margin sulcate,

<p>The gills are nearly adnate, yellowish, then livid-brown.</p>

<p>The stem is attenuated, yellowish, ring fugacious. This is rather common in
dairy pastures and is found from May to September.</p>


<h3><i>Psathyrella. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Psathyrella is from a Greek word meaning fragile. The members of this
genus are mebranaceous, striated, margin straight, at first pressed to the stem, not
extending beyond the gills. Gills adnate or free, sooty-black, not variegated. The
stem is confluent with, but different in character from, the spore-bearing surface.
Veil inconspicuous and generally absent.</p>

margin entire; yellowish then gray. Gills adnate, narrow, whitish, then gray,
finally blackish. Stem one to one and a half inches long, rather curved, mealy
then smooth, fragile, hollow. <i>Massee.</i></p>

<p>This is a very small plant, growing on grassy lawns, and very common on old
trunks, and about decaying stumps.</p>

<p>A cluster about two yards square shows itself at intervals all summer on the
Chillicothe High School lawn. The grass shows itself to be greener and thriftier
there on account of fertilization by the mushroom. The entire plant is very fragile
and soon melts away. I have eaten the caps raw many times and they have a rich
flavor. They are found from May till frost.</p>

<p>SubcÃ¦spitose; pileus 4 to 6 lines broad; stem 1 to 2 inches long to 1 1-5 lines
thick. The specimens in Figure 281 were found in the greenhouse at the State
University. When quite young tufts of white hair were very conspicuous. They
are scarcely observed in mature specimens. The plants were photographed by
Dr. Kellerman.</p>


<h3><i>Gomphidius. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Gomphidius is from a Greek word meaning a wooden bolt or peg.</p>

<p>The hymenophore is decurrent on the stem. The gills are decurrent, distant,
soft, somewhat mucilaginous; edge acute, pruinate with the blackish fusiform
spores; veil viscoso-floccose, forming an imperfect ring around the stem.</p>

<p>The gills are decurrent, distant, somewhat branched, firm, elastic, rather thick,
purple-brown with an olive tinge.</p>

<p>The stem is two to three inches high, subequal or slightly ventricose; pale
yellowish-brown, fibrillose, firm, solid, slimy from the remains of the veil, which
form an obsolete filamentose ring.</p>

<p>The spores are elongato-fusiform, 18&ndash;20Ã—6Âµ.</p>

<p>Its favorite habitat is under pine and fir trees. Its taste is sweet and it has the

POLYPORACEAE. TUBE-BEARING FUNGI.</h2>


<p>In this family the cap has no gills on the upper surface, but, instead, there
are small tubes or pores. This class of plants may be naturally divided into two
groups: The perishable fungi with the pores easily separating from the cap and
from each other, which may be called BoletaceÃ¦; and the leathery, corky, and
woody fungi, with pores permanently united to the cap and with each other,
making the family PolyporaceÃ¦.</p>

<p>In each group the spores are borne on the lining of the pore. A spore print
may be made in the same manner as from mushrooms having gills. The color of
the spores does not enter into the classification as in the case of the Agaricini.</p>

<p>The distinctive characteristics of these genera may be stated as follows:</p>



<div class="center">

</table></div>


<h3><i>Boletus. Dill.</i></h3>

<p><i>Boletus, a clod</i>. There are very many species under this genus and the beginner
will experience much trouble in separating the species with any degree
of assurance. The Boletus is distinguished from the other pore-bearing fungi by
the fact that the stratum of tubes is easily separable from the cap. In the
Polyporus the stratum of tubes cannot be separated.</p>

<p>Nearly all Boleti are terrestrial and have central stems. They grow in warm
and rainy weather. Many are very large and ponderous; fleshy and putrescent,
decaying soon after maturity. It is important to note whether the flesh changes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
color when bruised and whether the taste is pleasant or otherwise. When I first
began to study the Boleti there were but few species that were thought to be edible,
but the ban has been removed from very many, even from the most wicked,
Boletus Satanus.</p>

</div>

<p>The pileus is from
two to five inches in
diameter, rounded convex,
smooth, viscid
when moist, minutely
woolly, velvety or
scaly, color from nearly
white to almost
black, the flesh white.</p>

<p>The tubes are free
from the stem, white,
long, mouths minute
and round.</p>

<p>The stem is solid,
tapering slightly upward,
long, dingy-white;
roughened with
blackish-brown or reddish
dots or scales, this
being the most pronounced
characteristic
by which to distinguish
the species; three to
five inches long. The
spores are oblong fusiform
and brown.</p>

<p>Prof. Peck has described
a number of
varieties under this
species, most of which
depend on the color of the cap. All are edible and good.</p>

<p>This is a common plant, usually found in woods and shady waste places, from
June to October. Photographed by Prof. H. C. Beardslee.</p>

<p>The cracks in the cap become yellow, on which account this species is called
the Yellow-cracked Boletus. The taste of the flesh is sweet and agreeable.
Palmer compares it with the taste of a walnut. The plant should not be feared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
because the flesh turns blue when bruised. I first found this species in Whinnery's
woods, Salem, Ohio. The specimens in Figure 284 grew near Chillicothe

to yellowish-brown
or bright brick-red,
more or less fissured
with red cracks; the
flesh yellow, changing

<p>The stem is generally
stout, straight,
yellowish, and more
or less streaked or
spotted with the
color of the cap.
The spores are light
brown and spindle-shaped.
This species
will be easily
distinguished from
B. subtomentosus
because of its bright
color and the cracks
in the cap turning
red, whence the
name of the "Red-cracked
Boletus."</p>

Pileus light brown, tubes yellowish or greenish-yellow. Stem bulbous and faintly reticulate. Natural size.</p>
</div>

<p>This is quite a large and handsome plant and one rather easily recognized.
The firm caps of the young plant and the white tubes with their very indistinct
mouths, and the mature plants with the tubes changing to a greenish yellow with
their mouths quite distinct, are enough to identify the plant at once.</p>

<p>The pileus is convex or nearly plane; variable in color, light brown to dark
brownish-red, surface smooth but dull, cap from three to eight inches broad.
The flesh is white or yellowish, not changing color on being bruised or broken.</p>

<p>The tube-surface is whitish in very young plants, at length becoming yellow
and yellowish-green. Pore openings angled. The tubes depressed around the
stem, which is stout, bulbous, often disproportionately elongated; pale-brown;
straight or flexuous, generally with a fine raised net-work of pink lines near junction
of cap, sometimes extending to the base. The taste is agreeable and nutty,
especially when young. Woods and open places. July and August. Common
about Salem and Chillicothe, Ohio.</p>

<p>It is one of our best mushrooms. Captain McIlvaine says: "Carefully
sliced, dried, and kept where safe from mold, it may be prepared for the table at
any season."</p>

<p>Speciosus means handsome.</p>

<p>The pileus is three to six inches broad, at first very thick, subglobose, compact,
then softer, convex, glabrous or nearly so, red or deep scarlet. The flesh
is pale yellow or bright lemon-yellow, changing to blue where wounded.</p>

<p>The tubes are adnate, small, subrotund, plane, or slightly depressed around
the stem; bright lemon-yellow, becoming dingy-yellow with age, changing to

without and within,
sometimes reddish at
the base. The spores
are oblong-fusiform,
pale, ochraceous-brown,
10&ndash;12.5Ã—4&ndash;5Âµ.</p>

<p>The young specimen
can be recognized
by the whole
plant's being of a

the cap. The plant
quickly turns to
green, then blue,
wherever touched. It
has a wide distribution

<p>Pileus is two to four inches across, convex, then expanded, sometimes nearly
plane, frequently wavy, covered with an appressed tomentum; opaque, pale-buff,
grayish-yellow, or yellowish, flesh thick, white, quickly changing to a beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>

<p>The stem is two to
three inches long, ventricose,
hoary with fine
hair, stuffed at first,
then becoming hollow,
colored like the pileus.</p>

<p>The spores are
subelliptical, 10&ndash;12.5Ã—6&ndash;7.5Âµ.</p>

<p>The specimens in
Figure 288 were found
on rather steep wooded
hillsides, Sugar Grove,
Ohio. They were all
solitary. I have found
a few specimens about
Chillicothe. They are
widely distributed in

  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure</span> 289.&mdash;Boletus indecisus. One-half natural size.</p>
</div>

<p>Indecisus means undecided; so called because it favors very closely Boletus
felleus. There is a difference in the style of the two plants by which, after
continued tasting, the student can readily separate them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span></p>

<p>The pileus is three to four
inches broad, dry, slightly
downy, convex, ochraceous-brown,
plane, often irregular
on the margin, sometimes
wavy, flesh white, and unchangeable,
taste mild or
sweet.</p>

<p>The tube surface is nearly
plane and firmly set against
the stem, grayish, becoming
tinged with flesh color in age,
changing to a brown when
bruised; the mouths small
and nearly round. The stem
is covered with a fine mealy
substance, straight or flexuous,
sometimes reticulated
above. The spores are oblong,
brownish flesh color,
12.5&ndash;15Ã—4Âµ.</p>

<p>The B. indecisus can be
readily told from B. felleus by its sweet taste and brownish spores. It is my
favorite of all the Boleti, indeed I think it equals the best of mushrooms. Its
favorite habitat is under beech trees in the open. It is widely distributed from
Massachusetts to the west. Found in July and August.</p>

<p>Clavipes means club-footed. Pileus fleshy, convex, glabrous, grayish-red or
chestnut-color. Flesh white, unchangeable. The tubes at first concave or nearly
plane, white and stuffed, then convex, slightly depressed around the stem,
ochraceous-yellow. Stem mostly obclavate, inversely club-shaped, and reticulate to
the base. The spores oblong-fusiform, 12&ndash;15Ã—4&ndash;5Âµ. <i>Peck.</i> 51st Rep.</p>

<p>The club-footed Boletus is very closely related to B. edulis. It differs, perhaps,
in a more uniform color of the cap, and in having tubes less depressed
around the stem, and less tinted with green when mature. The stem is more
club-shaped and more completely reticulated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span></p>

<p>The pileus in the young plant is much more highly colored and fades out
in age, but the margin does not become paler than the disk as is often the case
with B. edulis. The specimens in Figure 290 were found in Michigan and
photographed by Dr. Fischer. They are quite as good as B. edulis.</p>

<p>The pileus is three to four inches broad, hemispherical at first, glabrous,
reddish-tawny or brown, brownish when dry, cracked in squares.</p>

<p>The tubes are free, convex, medium size, angular, longer toward the margin,
their mouths reddish.</p>

<p>The stem is solid, violaceous at the thickened base, red-reticulated at the
apex, expanded into the pileus.</p>

<p>The spores are pallid to ochraceous, oblong-fusiform, 10&ndash;20Âµ long. <i>Peck's</i>

<p>This species is very close to Boletus scaber and Boletus edulis. It differs
from B. scaber in its reticulated stem and from B. edulis in its larger tubes. The
specimens in Figure 291 were found by Hambleton Young near Columbus, and
were photographed by Dr. Kellerman.</p>


<h3><i>Boletus parvus. Pk.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span></h3>

umbonate, subtomentose, reddish. Flesh yellowish-white, slowly changing to
pinkish when bruised.</p>

<p>The tubes are nearly plane, adnate, their mouths rather large, angular, at first
bright-red, becoming reddish-brown.</p>

<p>The stem is equal or slightly thickened below, red, from one to two inches

<p>The stem is usually
quite long, covered
with depressions or pitted
dentations, with intermediate
coarse net-work
of raised ridges,
red and yellow. The
spores are yellowish-brown.
I found this
species in the woods
near Gallipolis, Ohio,
also near Salem, Ohio.
The bright color of its
cap will command the
attention of any one
passing near it. It has
been branded as a reprobate,
but Captain McIlvaine
gives it a good
reputation. Found in
the woods, especially
along streams, August
and September. Photographed

<p>Felleus is from <i>fel</i>, gall, bitter. The pileus is convex, nearly plane, at first
rather firm in substance, then becoming soft and cushion-like, smooth, without
polish, varying in color from pale ochre to yellowish or reddish-brown or chestnut,
flesh white, changing to flesh-color when bruised, taste exceedingly bitter, cap
three to eight inches in diameter.</p>

<p>The tube-surface is white at first, becoming dull pinkish with age or upon

mouths angular.</p>

<p>The stem is variable, tapering upward, rather stout, quite as smooth as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
cap and a shade paler in color, toward the apex covered with a net-work which
extends to the base, often bulbous.</p>

<p>The flesh is not poisonous but intensely bitter. No amount of cooking will
destroy its bitterness. I gave it a thorough trial, but it was as bitter after cooking
as before. It is a common
Boletus about Salem, Ohio. I
have seen plants there eight to
ten inches in diameter and very
heavy. They grow in woods

</div>

<p>Gracilis means slender, referring
to the stem.</p>

<p>The pileus is one to two inches
broad, convex, smooth or minutely
tomentose, the epidermis frequently
cracked as in the illustration;
ochraceous-brown, tawny, or reddish
brown; flesh white.</p>

<p>The tube surface is convex to
plane, depressed around the stem,
nearly free, whitish, becoming
flesh-colored.</p>

<p>The stem is long and slender,
equal or slightly tapering upward,
usually curved; pruinose or mealy.
The spores are subferruginous,
.0005 to .0007 inch long, .0002 to
.00025 inch broad.</p>

<p>This is quite a pretty plant, but at first sight it will not be taken for a
Boletus. They are not plentiful in our woods. I find them only occasionally and
then sparsely. They are found in July and August, the months for the Boleti.
They grow in leaf mold in mixed woods, especially among beech timber.</p>


<h3><i>Boletus striÃ¦pes. Secr.</i></h3>

<p>StriÃ¦pes means striate stem.</p>

<p>The pileus is convex or plane, soft, silky, olivaceous, the cuticle rust-color
within, flesh white, yellow next the tubes, sparingly changing to blue.</p>

<p>The tubes are adnate, greenish, their mouths minute, angular, yellow.</p>

<p>The stem is firm, curved, marked with brownish-black striations, yellow, and
brownish-rufescent at the base.</p>

<p>The spores are 10&ndash;13Ã—4Âµ. <i>Peck</i>, Boleti of the U. S.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span></p>

<p>I found some beautiful specimens in a mixed woods on the Edinger hillside,
near Chillicothe. I located them here, but observing that this species was not
common I sent some to Prof. Atkinson, who placed them under this species.
August.</p>


<h3><i>Boletus radicans. Pers.</i></h3>

<p>The pileus is convex, dry, subtomentose, olivaceous-cinereus, becoming pale-yellowish,
the margin thin, involute. Flesh pale-yellow, taste bitterish.</p>

<p>The tubes are adnate, their mouths large, unequal; lemon-yellow.</p>

<p>The stem is two to three inches long, even, tapering downward and radiating,
flocculose with a reddish bloom, pale-yellow, becoming naked and dark with a
touch.</p>

<p>The spores are fusiform, olive, 10&ndash;12.5Ã—5Âµ. <i>Peck</i>, Boleti of the U. S.</p>

<p>I found these specimens in the same locality with the B. striÃ¦pes.</p>

<p>The olivaceous cap with its peculiar involute margin and its radiating stem
will greatly assist in its determination. August.</p>

</div>

<p>Subluteus is from <i>sub</i>, under, nearly; <i>luteus</i>, yellow.</p>

<p>Pileus is two to three inches broad, convex, becoming plane, quite viscid
when moist, dull yellowish to reddish brown, frequently more or less streaked.
The flesh is whitish or dull yellow.</p>

<p>The tube surface is plane or convex, the tubes set squarely against the stem,
being small, nearly round, yellowish or ochraceous, becoming darker in age.</p>

<p>The stem is rather long, nearly equal, about the color of the cap, dotted
both above the ring and below it; the ring is membranaceous, quite variable and
persistent, usually collapsing as a narrow ring on the stem. The spores are
ochraceous-brown, oblong or elliptical, 8&ndash;10Ã—4&ndash;5.</p>

<p>Prof. Atkinson has made a careful study of both the American and the
European plants called in this country B. luteus and B. subluteus, and has come
to the conclusion that they
should all be called B.
luteus. In distinguishing
the two we usually say
those having much gluten
and dotted above the ring
are B. luteus, and those
dotted both above and below
the ring are B. subluteus.
The specimens in
Figure 297 were collected
at the State Farm at Lancaster,
Ohio, and photographed
by Dr. Kellerman.
They are found in July and
August.</p>

<p>The specimens in Figure 299 were found at Londonderry, about fifteen miles
east of Chillicothe, in a grassy woods near a stream. The taste is agreeable

<p>The stem is subequal, cespitose, reticulate to the base, pulverulent below.
The spores are greenish-ochraceous, 12&ndash;15Ã—4&ndash;5Âµ. <i>Peck</i>, Boleti.</p>

<p>B. retipes is very close to B. ornatipes, but its manner of growth, its pulverulent
cap, and its greenish-ochraceous spores will at once distinguish it. I
have found them on Ralston's Run, a number from the same mycelial cluster,
as in Figure 301. The caps only are good. The specimens in the figure were

<p>This plant is found in company with
B. Russelli, which it resembles very
closely. Its smooth, viscid cap and
white flesh will distinguish it. Its stem
is much more rough in wet weather

whitish, becoming reddish or violaceous where wounded. Tubes free, yellow,
their mouths bright red, becoming orange-colored with age. The stem thick,
ovate-ventricose, marked above with red reticulations. <i>Peck</i>, Boleti of U. S.</p>

<p>Hamilton Gibson and Captain McIlvaine seem to give his Satanic majesty

<h3><i>Strobilomyces. Berk.</i></h3>

<p>Strobilomyces is from two Greek words meaning a pine-cone and a fungus.
The hymenophore is even, tubes not easily separable from it, large and equal. It
is of a brownish-gray color, its shaggy surface more or less studded with deep-brown
or black woolly points, each at the center of a scale-like segment. The
tubes beneath are covered at first with a veil which breaks and is often found on
the rim of the cap. It is a plant that will quickly attract attention.</p>

<p>Strobilaceus, cone-like. This is especially emphasized from the fact that
both the genus and the species are named from the fancied resemblance of the
cap to a pine cone. It is ever readily recognized because of this character of
the cap.</p>

<p>The pileus is convex, rough with dark umber scales drawn into regular
cone-like points tipped with dark-brown; margin veiled, flesh grayish-white,
turning red when bruised, and finally black.</p>

<p>Pore-surface grayish-white in young specimens, and usually covered with
the veil; tubes attached to the stem, angular, turning red when bruised.</p>

<p>The stem is equal or tapering upward, furrowed at the top, covered with a
woolly down. Spores dark-brown, 12&ndash;13Ã—9Âµ. Found at Londonderry. Common
in woods. August to September.</p>


<h3><i>Boletinus. Kalchb.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span></h3>

<p>Boletinus is a diminutive of Boletus.</p>

<p>Hymenium composed of broad radiating lamellÃ¦, connected by very numerous
and narrow anastomosing branches or partitions, forming large angular
pores. Tubes somewhat tenacious, not easily separable from the hymenophore and

<p>Pictus, painted. This plant seems to delight in damp pine woods, but I have
found it only occasionally about Chillicothe, under beech trees. It is readily recognized
by the red fibrillose tomentum which covers the entire plant when young. As
the plant expands the reddish tomentum is broken into scales of the
same color, revealing the yellowish color of the pileus beneath. The flesh is
compact, yellow, often changing to a dull pinkish or reddish tint where wounded.</p>

<p>The tube-surface is at first pale yellow, but becomes darker with age, often
changing to pinkish, with a brown tinge where bruised.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span></p>

<p>The stem is solid, equal, and covered with a cottony layer of mycelium-threads
like the pileus, though often paler. The spores are ochraceous, 15&ndash;18Ã—6&ndash;8Âµ.
The plants are two to four inches broad, and one and a half to three inches high.
Found from July to October.</p>

  </a>
  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 314.</span>&mdash;Boletinus cavipes.</p>
</div>

<p>Cavipes is from two Latin words meaning a hollow stem.</p>

<p>The pileus is broadly convex, rather tough, flexible, soft, subumbonate,
fibrillose-scaly, tawny-brown, sometimes tinged with reddish or purplish, flesh
yellowish. The tubes are slightly decurrent, at first pale-yellow, then darker and
tinged with green, becoming dingy-ochraceous with age. The stem is equal or
slightly tapering upward, somewhat fibrillose or floccose, slightly ringed, hollow,
tawny-brown or yellowish-brown, yellowish at the top and marked by the
decurrent dissepiments of the tubes, white within. Veil whitish, partly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
adhering to the margin of the pileus,
soon disappearing. The spores are
8&ndash;10Ã—4Âµ. <i>Peck</i>, in Boleti of the
U. S.</p>

<p>This plant grows in New York and
the New England states, under pine and
tamarack trees. The caps are convex,
covered with a tawny-brown fibrillose
tomentum. The stems of those I have
seen are hollow from the first. The
plants in Figure 314 were sent me from
Massachusetts by Mrs. Blackford.</p>

  </a>
  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 315.</span>&mdash;Boletinus porosus. Two-thirds natural size. Caps nut-brown, yellowish-brown or olivaceous.</p>
</div>

<p>These form a small but interesting
species, not usually exceeding three and
a half inches in diameter nor more than
two inches in height.</p>

<p>The cap is somewhat fleshy, nut-brown,
or yellowish-brown, shading
to olivaceous in color in most of the
specimens which I have found; when fresh and moist, somewhat sticky and
shining. The margins are thin, rather even, and inclined to be involute;
the shape of the cap is more or less irregular, in many cases almost
kidney-shaped.</p>

<p>The stem is laterally attached, tough, and gradually expands into
the pileus which it resembles in color; it is markedly reticulated at
the top by the decurrent walls of the spore-tubes. The spore-surface
is yellow, the tubes arranged in radiating rows, some being more
prominent than others, the partitions often assuming the form of
gills which branch and are connected by cross partitions of less prominence.
The stratum of tubes, while soft, is very tenacious, not separating
from the flesh of the pileus.</p>

<p>The odor and taste of all the specimens found were pleasant. Found in
damp woods in July and August. When a sufficient number can be found they
make an excellent dish.</p>

<p>It is found in abundance about Chillicothe.</p>


<h3><i>Fistulina. Bull.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span></h3>

<p>Fistulina means a small pipe; so called because the tubes stand close together
and separate easily one from another.</p>

<p>The hymenophore is fleshy and hymenium inferior. When first seen springing
from a stump or root it looks like a large strawberry. It soon develops into the
appearance of a big red tongue. When young the upper side is quite velvety
and peach-colored, later it becomes a livid red and loses its velvety appearance.
The under surface is flesh-colored and is rough like the surface of a tongue, owing
to the fact that the tubes are free from one another. When it is moist it is very
viscid, making your hands quite blood-stained in appearance.</p>

Beefsteak mushroom.</p>
</div>

<p>This is a beautiful plant, quite common where there are chestnut stumps and
trees. I have found it on chestnut oak, quite large specimens, too. It is one of my
favorite mushrooms; one cannot afford to pass it by. Its beautiful color will
attract attention at once, and having once eaten it well prepared, one will never
pass a chestnut stump without examining it.</p>

  </a>
  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 317.</span>&mdash;Fistulina hepatica. One-half natural size.</p>
</div>

<p>The pileus is fan-shaped or semicircular, red-juicy, flesh when cut somewhat
mottled like beet-root and giving forth a very appetizing odor; the cap is moist
and somewhat viscid, the color varying from a red (somewhat beefy) to a
reddish-brown in older plants; while the spore surface varies from strawberry-pink
through a light-and dark-tan to an almost chestnut-brown.</p>

<p>In young plants the color is much richer and more vivid than in those of
greater maturity. The spore surface resembles nothing so much as a very fine
sponge, the spore-tubes being short, crowded, yet distinct.</p>

<p>The marked peculiarity of its mode of growth is in the attachment of the stem;
somewhat thick, fleshy, and juicy, coming from the side of the pileus like the
handle of a fan, it looks as if some one had taken hold of the cap and given
it a partial twist to the right or to the left, as may be seen in Figure 317.
Another peculiarity I have noticed in this species consists of the nerve-like lines,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
or veinlets, radiating from the stem and streaking the upper surface of the cap.
The taste, when raw, is slightly but pleasantly acid. Its favorite habitat
seems to be injured places on chestnut trees, and about chestnut stumps. It is
known as Liver Fungus, Beefsteak Fungus, Oak-Tongue, Chestnut-Tongue, etc.
It is found from July to October.</p>

<p>I have found it plentiful about Chillicothe on chestnut stumps, and quite
generally over the state. I found some very fine specimens on the chestnut oaks,
about Bowling Green, Ohio.</p>

<p>When properly prepared it is equal to any kind of meat. It is one of our
best mushrooms.</p>

<p>Pallida means pale. Pileus kidney-shaped, pallid-red, fawn or clay-color,
thick at the base and thinning toward the margin, which is often crenate and
inflexed; pulverulent, firm, flexible, tough; flesh white.</p>

<p>The tubes are long and slender, mouths somewhat enlarged, whitish, the tube<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
surface a pale cream-color and minutely mealy, pores not decurrent but ending
with the beginning of the stem.</p>

<p>The stem is uniformly attached to the concave margin of the cap; attenuated
downward; whitish below, but near the cap it changes to the same tint. The
peculiar manner of attachment of the stem will serve to identify the species,
which I have found several times near Chillicothe. The specimen in the illustration
was found on the State farm, and photographed by Dr. Kellerman.</p>


<h3><i>Polyporus. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Polyporus is from two Greek words meaning many and pores. In this genus
the stratum of the pores is not easily separated from the cap. Most of the
species under this genus are tough and corky. Many grow on decayed wood, a
few on the ground, but even these are inclined to be tough. Very few of those
growing on wood have a central stem and many have apparently no stem at all.</p>

<p>Picipes is from <i>pix</i>, pitch or black, and <i>pes</i>, foot.</p>

<p>The pileus is fleshy, rigid, coriaceous, tough, even, smooth, depressed either
behind or in the center; livid with a chestnut-colored disk.</p>

<p>The pores are decurrent, rounded, small, tender, white, finally reddish-gray.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span></p>

<p>The stem is eccentric and lateral, equal, firm; at first velvety, then naked;
punctate with black dots, becoming black.</p>

<p>The stem at the base is pitch-black, as will be seen in Figure 319. The
margin of the cap is very thin and the caps are irregularly funnel-form. This
plant is widely distributed over the United States and is quite common about
Chillicothe. Found in damp woods on decayed logs from July to November.
When very young and tender it can be eaten.</p>

broad, sooty, dull-red, united at the base. Pores are minute and white.
White pileoli have sometimes occurred. <i>Fries.</i></p>

<p>The tufts, as will be observed from Figure 320, are very dense, and there
seems to be no limit to their branching. Notice that every cap is depressed or
umbilicate. The specimen in Figure 320 was collected near Mammoth Cave,
Kentucky, by Mr. C. G. Lloyd, Cincinnati, and through his courtesy I have used
his print. I have found the plant about Chillicothe and Sidney, Ohio. It is
found on decayed roots on the ground, or on stumps. When the caps are fresh
they are quite good.</p>

<p>The stem is one to three inches long, stout, unequal, somewhat tomentose,
sooty-black, becoming black internally. The pileus and stem become black in
places.</p>

<p>The spores are cylindric-fusoid, pale-brown, 10&ndash;12Ã—4&ndash;5Âµ.</p>

<p>They are usually found in pine woods. The caps are often deformed and
are easily broken. The pores resemble those of a Boletus. The plant is quite
widely distributed. The one in Figure 322 was found in Massachusetts by Mrs.
Blackford, and I photographed it after it was partially dry. It is probably the
same as P. griseus, P.</p>

<p>Sulphureus, pertaining to sulphur, so called from the color of the tube-bearing
surface. In mature specimens the growth is horizontal, spreading fan-like
from the stem, undulating with radiating flutings. The upper surface is
salmon, orange, or orange-red; flesh cheesy, light-yellow, the edge being smooth
and unevenly thickened with nodule-like prominences. In young specimens the
ascending, under yellow surface outwardly exposed.</p>

<p>The pore surface is a bright sulphur-yellow, which is more persistent than
the color of the cap; pores very minute, short, often formed of inflexed masses.</p>

<p>The stem is short, a mere close attachment for the spreading growth. The
taste is slightly acid and mucilaginous when raw. The spores are elliptical and
white, 7&ndash;8Ã—4&ndash;5Âµ.</p>

<p>It grows on decayed logs, on stumps, and on decayed places in living trees.
The mycelium of this species will frequently be found in the hearts of trees and
remain there for years before the tree is injured sufficiently for the mycelium to
come to the surface. It may take months, or a century, to accomplish this.</p>

<p>When this plant is young and tender it is a prime favorite with all who know
it. It is found from August to November. Its favorite host is an oak stump
or log.</p>

</div>

<p>Flavovirens means yellowish-green or olivaceous.</p>

<p>The pileus is quite large, three to six inches broad, convex, expanded funnel-form
or repand, fleshy, tomentose, yellowish-green or olivaceous; frequently the
pileus is cracked when old; flesh white.</p>

<p>The pores are not large, toothed, white or whitish, decurrent upon the stem
which is tapering.</p>

<p>This plant is very common on the oak hillsides about Chillicothe. The
plants in Figure 327 were found by Miss Margaret Mace on the Governor
Tiffin farm, about twelve miles north of Chillicothe, growing in large groups under
oak trees. It is edible though often tough. It is found in August and September.
It is very abundant in this region.</p>

</div>

<p>Heteroclitus is from two Greek words; one of two and to lean, referring to
its habit of growth, leaning apparently upon the ground or the base of a tree or
stump. It is cÃ¦spitose and coriaceous. The pileoli are two and a half inches
broad, orange and sessile, expanded on all sides from the radical tubercle, lobed,
villous, zoneless.</p>

<p>The pores are irregularly shaped and elongated, golden yellow. <i>Fries.</i></p>

<p>The specimen in Figure 328 was found by Mr. Beyerly at Richmond Dale,
Ohio. It was over a foot in diameter and eight inches high, growing in many
cÃ¦spitose layers, on the ground under an oak tree, from a radical tubercle. The
flesh was juicy and tender, breaking easily. The radical tubercle from which it
grew was filled with a milky juice. The flesh was somewhat lighter in color than
the outside pilei, which extended horizontally from the tubercle. It is a very
showy and attractive plant, and as Captain McIlvaine remarks, it looks like a
"mammoth dahlia" in bloom. When young and tender it is good, but in age it
becomes rank. This plant was found July 1st. It grows in the months of June
and July.</p>

<p>Radicatus, from the long root the plant has.
The pileus is fleshy, quite tough, cushion-shaped,
slightly depressed, pale sooty, somewhat
downy.</p>

<p>The pores are decurrent, quite large, obtuse,
equal, white.</p>

<p>The stem is very long, often eccentric,
tapering downward, sometimes ventricose as
in Figure 329, rooting quite deep, black below.</p>

<p>It is found on the ground in the woods and
in old clearings beside old trees and stumps.</p>

<p>The blackish or brown pileus, which is more
or less tomentose, with a black stem more or
less deformed, will serve to distinguish the
species. Found from September to November.</p>

irregular, hairy-tomentose to setose-hispid, grayish-tawny, or ferruginous, the
margin subacute, sterile, the substance within tawny-ferruginous, somewhat
zonate.</p>

<p>The pores are two to three lines long, unequal, angular, the dissepiments
becoming brownish-ferruginous with age or where bruised. The spores are
ferruginous, broadly elliptical, .00024 to .0003 inch long and about .0002 broad.
<i>Peck.</i></p>

<p>This is very abundant on beech logs, growing quite large, massive, imbricated,
and confluent, the pileoli being often two to four inches broad. It is very
closely related to P. cuticularis and P. hispidus. It can be easily distinguished
from P. cuticularis by means of its straight margin, and from P. hispidus by its
small size and smaller pores. Found from September to November.</p>


<h3><i>Polyporus hispidus. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Pileus is very large, eight to ten inches broad and three to four inches thick,
compact, spongy, fleshy but fibrous, dimidiate, with occasionally a very short
stem; generally very hairy, but sometimes smooth; the pileus is often marked
with concentric lines which seem to indicate arrested vegetation; brown, blackish,
yellowish or reddish brown, below pale-yellow or rich sienna-brown, margin paler.</p>

<p>The pores are minute, round, inclined to separate, fringed, paler. The spores
are yellowish, apiculate, 10Ã—7Âµ. Often found on living trees, the plant gains
entrance to the living stem through the bark, by means of a wound made by
some agency, as a bird or a boring insect; soon a mass of mycelium is formed,
and from this the fruiting body is produced.</p>


<h3><i>Polyporus cuticularis. Fr.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span></h3>

<p>Pileus is quite thin, spongy, fleshy, then dry; plane, hairy-tomentose, ferruginous,
then blackish-brown; margin fibrous, fimbriate, internally loose and parallel,
fibrous.</p>

<p>The pores are long, quite small, pale, then ochraceous; pores longer than
the thickness of the flesh. The spores are yellow or ochraceous, very abundant,
7Ã—4&ndash;5Âµ. The hairs on the pileus are three-cleft.</p>

<p>This is very frequent in beech woods about Chillicothe. Found in September
and October.</p>


<h3><i>Polyporus circinatus. Fr.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Round Polyporus. Edible.</span></p>

<p>Circinatus is from <i>circinus</i>, a pair of compasses, hence means rounded like
a circle.</p>

<p>The pileus is three to four inches across, with a double cap, one cap within
another, both being compact, thick, round, plane, zoneless, velvety, rusty-yellow
to reddish-brown, the flesh being of the same color. The upper cap is pliable,
compact, soft, and covered with a soft tomentum, the lower cap, contiguous with
the stem, is woody and corky.</p>

<p>The pores are decurrent, extending down the stem, entire, rather small,
dusky-gray.</p>

<p>The stem is short and rather thick, often swollen, covered with a reddish-brown
tomentum.</p>

<p>This is an odd but handsome species and easily determined because of its
double cap. It is said to prefer fir woods, but I have frequently found it in oak
woods. It grows on the ground, and when young and fresh the pilei are said
to be good. I have never found more than one specimen at a time and never
in a condition to eat, though good authorities say it is edible when young and
tender. Found in September and October.</p>


<h3><i>Polyporus adustus. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Adustus means scorched, so called from the blackish color of margin.</p>

<p>The pileus is often imbricated; fleshy, tough, firm, thin, villous, ash-color;
margin straight, blackish.</p>

<p>The pores are minute, round, obtuse, whitish, soon ashy-brown.</p>

<p>It is abundant everywhere on fallen beech or on beech stumps. It is very
close to P. fumosus if it is not identical with it. It is found from August to
late fall.</p>

</div>

<p>Pileus from three to six, and frequently eight, inches long; rich-brown, varying
from bright cinnamon to red, handsomely marked with delicate pencilings
radiating from the axis of growth; the color of the pileus seems to form a binding
about the edge of the light-gray pore surface, which is closely punctured with
minute elliptical pores.</p>

<p>The color of the pore surface readily changes to brown upon slight pressure.
The whole plant is full of a brownish juice which exudes freely upon pressure.
The plant is shelving and imbricated upon the side of a log, without any apparent
stem.</p>

<p>Taken altogether the Polyporus resinosus presents one of the handsomest
specimens of fungus growth that one will be likely to find in a long day's tramp.
When fresh and growing it has rather a pleasant taste.</p>

<p>It is found during October and November, growing on decayed logs, being
partial to the beech. Its abundance is equal to its beauty.</p>

<p>The pileus is two to three or more inches broad, usually very irregular,
brownish-maroon, with a distinct double zone of duller dark-brown and tan.
Cap glazed especially in the center, wrinkled.</p>

<p>The spore surface is a very light grayish-brown in the young plant, changing
to almost a tan in older ones, pores labyrinthiform.</p>

<p>The stem is irregular, knotted and swollen with protuberances somewhat resembling
buds, from which develop the caps which in some cases appear as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
stuck on the stem like barnacles
on a stick. Contrary to
most mushrooms the upper
surface of the cap and the
stem are of nearly the same
color, the stem being usually
of a more brilliant red. The
stem has a distinct root extending
into the ground several
inches. The whole plant
is almost indescribably irregular.
It is quite an attractive
plant when seen growing
among the weeds and beside
stumps. The plants in Figure
332 I found growing among
Datura stramonium beside old
stumps in a pasture. I have found the same species growing on oak stumps. It
is known as Ganoderma Curtisii, Berk., G. pseudo-boletus, Merrill. It is found
from August till late fall.</p>

<p>Obliquus means slanting, oblique.
This species is widely circumfused,
usually hard, quite
thick, uneven, pallid, elegant chocolate-brown,
then blackish; conversely
encircled crested border.</p>

<p>The pores are long, very minute,
obtuse, slightly angular. It grows
on dead branches of iron-wood and
wild cherry. The deep chocolate-brown
and the oblique form of its
pores will serve to identify the
species.</p>

<p>It grows, with us, in the spring.
I gathered this specimen in June.
In the fall I visited the same trunk,
but found they had begun to decay.
It is sometimes called Poria
obliqua.</p>

mass, Figure 334. Pileoli innumerable,
inflexed and appressed,
plicate, brown.</p>

<p>Pores concealed, very minute,
round, pale-brown, the dissepiments
thick and obtuse. <i>Morgan.</i></p>

<p>This is a very interesting plant
because of its peculiar mode of
growth. It is found in woods or
clearings on dead logs or on standing
dead trees. In some parts of
the state it is quite common. From
the illustration, Figure 334, it will
be seen that the plant consists of an
innumerable number of pileoli forming
a subglobose or elongated mass.
They are frequently three to six
inches in diameter and several
inches long. I have seen them very
much elongated on standing trees.
When it is young and growing it
is shiny in appearance and has a
reddish and sometimes a purplish
tint. The inner substance is ferruginous
but covered with a hard
brown crust. The pores are brown,
and when examined with the glass
are seen to be lined with a very fine
pubescence. The imbricated form
of the pileoli show very plainly in
the illustration.</p>

appears late, in cold weather.
The specimens in Figure 335
were found in December.</p>

<p>The pileus is from one to
three inches broad, nearly
plane, slightly depressed in the
center; somewhat fleshy and
tough; dingy-brown, clothed
with minute scales, becoming
smooth, pallid.</p>

<p>The pores are oval, slightly
angular, slender, acute, denticulate,
white, 5&ndash;6Ã—2Âµ.</p>

<p>The stem is short, thin,
slightly bulbous at the base,
hirsute or squamulose, pale,
central.</p>

<p>It usually occurs singly but
frequently you will find several
in a group. Found on sticks and logs, they are quite hard to detach from
their hosts. Too tough to eat. It equals Polyporus polyporus. (Retz) Merrill.</p>


<h3><i>Polyporus rufescens. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>The tube surface is of a dingy cream color, openings oblong, almost diamond-shaped,
resembling the meshes of a net, the meshes being smaller on the margin,
shallow, simply marked out at the top of the stem.</p>

<p>The stem is dark-brown, minutely scaly, mottled, with a ground work of cream-color;
hollow. Common in the spring of the year on sticks and decayed wood
in fields or in old clearings. It is quite generally distributed. Edible but tough.</p>


<h3><i>Polyporus elegans. Fr.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span></h3>

<p>The pileus is fleshy, soon becoming woody; expanded, even, smooth, pallid.</p>

<p>Pores are plane, minute, nearly round, pallid, yellowish-white.</p>

<p>The stem is eccentric, even, smooth, pallid; base from the first abruptly black.
This is quite common on rotten wood in the forests. It resembles P. picipes
both in appearance and habitat.</p>


<h3><i>Polyporus medulla-panis. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Effused, determinate, subundulate, firm, smooth, white, circumference naked,

rather thin, smooth or sometimes slightly roughened by a slight strigose tomentum,
especially toward the margin; whitish, tinged more or less with fuscus; flesh pure
white, odor acidulous.</p>

<p>The pores are nearly plane, minute, subrotund, about two lines long; white,
inclining to yellowish, the dissepiments thin, acute.</p>

<p>The spores are minute, cylindrical, curved, white, .00016 to .0002 inch long.

obtuse, smooth, pale reddish-brown when mature, often mottled, roundish, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
somewhat reniform, zoneless, the oblique vertex in the form of an umbo; pellicle
thin, separating; flesh white, very thick.</p>

<p>The pores are short, round, minute, unequal, separable from the pileus when
fresh, but really concrete with it; white or tinged with brown, developing slowly;
when mature there are peculiar hair-like scales attached to the pore-surface,
making the plant look like a Hydnum when viewed from the side. It is found
wherever the birch tree grows. When young and fresh it is edible, but with a
strong flavor unpleasant to many. In this state the deer eat it. The specimen

It is easily identified by the beautiful
carmine color of the pileus
and the pore surface, the latter
being a shade darker than the
former, as will be seen in Figure
338.</p>

<p>The specimens photographed
were found in December. They
grow on dead logs and branches,
commonly on the oak and wild
cherry, sometimes on maple. It is

</div>

<p>Volvatus, bearing a volva. This is a most interesting species. The pileus
seems to be prolonged, making a volva-like protection of the spore surface.
When this volva is ruptured small heaps of spores will often be seen on the
volva, having been protected from the wind.</p>

<p>The plant is small, somewhat round, and before the volva is ruptured it is
very like a puffball; fleshy, smooth, attached by a small point, whitish, slightly
tinged with yellow,
red or reddish-brown;
the cuticle
of the pileus enveloping
the entire
pore-surface, thick
and firm. The
pores are rather
long, small, the
mouths yellowish,
with a tinge of
brown. The spores
are elliptical and
flesh-colored, .0003
to .00035 inch long
and about .0002
broad.</p>

<p>This plant has a
wide distribution, being found in the New England and Eastern States, and the
States of the Pacific slope. I presume it will be found wherever the spruce tree
is a native.</p>

<p>The specimens in Figure 340 were found near Boston and were sent me

examining them, to be a new puffball, which they seemed to resemble in their
undeveloped state.</p>

  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 341.</span>&mdash;Polystictus biformis. Natural size. Frequently covered with green lichen.</p>
</div>

<p>Biformis means two shapes or appearances; referring to the condition of the
pores in the young and the old plant.</p>

<p>The pileus is two to three inches wide, projecting from one to three inches,
often imbricated so as to cover a large surface; laterally confluent, coriaceous,
flexible, tough, subzonate, with innate radiating fibres, the cortex fibrillose,
concolorous.</p>

<p>The pores at first very large, simple, compound, or confluent, round, elon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>gated,
flexuous; the dissepiments dentate, then lacerate, the hymenium finally
resolved into teeth.</p>

<p>When I first found this plant the hymenium had resolved into teeth, and I
supposed that I had found an Irpex. It is found in woods on logs and stumps.
Very common with us. Frequently covered with a green lichen. July to
November.</p>

<p>Hirsutus means hairy or bristly. The pileus is corky, coriaceous, convex,
then plane, hairy with rigid bristles, zoned with concentric furrows; of one color,
whitish, sometimes these zones are quite marked as in Figure 342.</p>

<p>The pore surface is at first white, or whitish, becoming dark or brownish
in age. The pores are round, the walls rather thick. It is found on logs and
stumps in the woods. It is a very common plant and widely distributed.</p>


<h3><i>Polystictus versicolor. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Versicolor means varying colors. The pileus is coriaceous, thin,
rigid, plane, depressed behind; quite velvety, nearly even and shining,
variegated with colored zones, sometimes entirely white or grayish-white,
not unfrequently the whole surface is villous or woolly, and the
zones mere depressions.</p>

<p>The pores are
minute, round,
acute, lacerated,
white or cream-color.</p>

<p>It is very common,
as well as
very variable in
form and color.
It is frequently
found on logs
and is then
densely imbricated.
On our
hillsides it frequently
grows
on a small bush
as in Figure 343.
It is one of the
most beautiful
plants in the
woods.</p>


<h3><i>Polyporus gilvus. Schw.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span></h3>

<p>Gilvus means pale-yellow or deep-reddish flesh-color.</p>

<p>The pileus is corky, woody, hard, effuso-reflexed, imbricate, concrescent,
subtomentose, then scabrous, uneven, reddish-yellow, then subferruginous, the
margin acute.</p>

<p>The pores are minute, round, entire, brownish-ferruginous. <i>Morgan.</i></p>

<p>It is very abundant throughout the state, being found on all kinds of logs

  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 344.</span>&mdash;Polystictus cinnamoneus.</p>
</div>

<p>The pileus is an inch and a half, or less, broad, coriaceous, slightly depressed
in the center; rather rough on the surface, but with a beautiful satiny lustre, and
more or less zoned; caps often growing together, but with separate stems; shining,
a light cinnamon-brown.</p>

<p>The spores are rather
large, angular, torn with
age; cinnamon-brown,
growing darker in older
plants.</p>

<p>The stem is one to
two inches long, equal,
or slightly tapering upward,
cinnamon-brown,
hollow or stuffed, tough,
frequently sending forth
branches from the side
and base of the stem.</p>

<p>This is quite a beautiful
plant, growing usually
in patches of moss.
The caps have quite a
glossy cinnamon-brown
surface, which will attract
the attention of any
one. They are very
small and easily overlooked.
Found in August
and September.</p>

<p>This plant is called P.
subsericeus by Dr. Peck.</p>

<p>The pileus is thin, pliant when fresh but somewhat brittle when dry. It is
minutely velvety on the upper surface, reddish-brown or cinnamon in color;
expanded or umbilicate to nearly funnel-shaped. The surface is beautifully
marked by radiations and fine concentric zones.</p>

<p>The stem is also velvety. The spore-tubes are minute, the walls thin and
acute, and the mouths angular, and at last more or less torn. The margin of the
cap is finely fimbriate, but in old specimens those hairs are apt to become rubbed
off. <i>Atkinson.</i></p>

<p>I found specimens by the roadside near Lone Tree Hill, near Chillicothe.
It is the only place in which I have found this plant. I have found Polystictus
subsericeus, or, as Prof. Atkinson calls it, P. cinnamomeus, in a number of
localities.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span></p>

<p>Pergamenus means parchment.</p>

<p>The pileus is coriaceous, thin, effused, reflexed, villous, zoned, cinereous-white,
with colored zone; pliant when fresh.</p>

<p>The pores are unequal, torn, violaceous, then pallid. It is very common here
on beech, maple, and wild cherry. The pores become torn so that they resemble
the teeth of the Hydnum. This is one of the most common fungi in our woods.</p>

<p>The photograph is by Prof. J. D. Smith, of Akron, O.</p>


<h3><i>Fomes leucophÃ¦us. Mont.</i></h3>

<p>This has been called by many authors in America Fomes applanatus or
Polyporus applanatus. It is very common in this country but very rare in Europe,
while Fomes applanatus, which is common in Europe, is very scarce in the United
States. In general appearance they are much alike, the applanatus having a
softer tissue and echinulate spores, but our common species, leucophÃ¦us, has
smooth spores.</p>

<p>The pileus is expanded, tuberculose, obsoletely zoned, pulverulent, or smooth;
cinnamon, becoming whitish; cuticle crustaceous, rigid, at length fragile, very
soft within; loosely floccose, margin tumid; white, then cinnamon. The pores are
very small, slightly ferruginous, orifice whitish, brownish when bruised. The
spore surface when fresh is soft and white.</p>

<p>This attractive plant is very common in our woods and furnishes an excellent
stencil surface for drawing. Found all the year round.</p>


<h3><i>Fomes fomentarius. Fr.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Bracket Fomes.</span></p>

<p>This species is very common in our woods. The brackets resemble a horse's
hoof in shape. They are smoky, gray, and of various shades of brown. The
upper surface of the bracket is quite strongly zoned and furrowed, so as to show
each year's growth. The margin is thick and blunt, and the tube surface is
concave; the openings of the tubes quite large, so that they can be readily seen by
the naked eye. The tube surface is reddish-brown when mature. The inside
was formerly used in making tinder-sticks, which were made by rolling the
fungus wood until it was perfectly flexible and then dipping it into saltpetre.</p>

<p>Rimosus means cracked. The fine checks in the pileus are clearly seen in
the halftone.</p>

<p>The pileus is pulvinate-ungulate, much dilated, deeply sulcate; cinnamon,
then brown or blackish; very much cracked or rimose. It is very hard, fibrous,
tawny-ferruginous; the margin broad, pruinate-velvety, rather acute.</p>

<p>The pores are minute, indistinctly stratified, tawny-ferruginous, the mouths
rhubarb-color. <i>Morgan.</i></p>

<p>This plant is very common on the locust trees about Chillicothe. I have
never found it on other wood.</p>

<p>Pinicola means dwelling on pine. It is found on dead pine, spruce, balsam,
and other conifers. It resembles Fomes leucophÃ¦us but is somewhat stouter and
does not have as hard and firm a crust. The young growth is at the margin, and
is whitish or tinged with yellow, while the old zones are reddish. The tube surface
is whitish-yellow or yellowish. This is frequently called Polyporus pinicolus.

<p>This is rather a common species in our state; black or brownish-black in
color, somewhat triangular in shape, and frequently hoof-shaped. The zones
indicating the yearly growth are plainly marked, and the tubes are quite long
and of a dark brown color. Their growth is rather slow, and it requires years
to produce some of the moderate sized specimens. Prof. Atkinson of Cornell
University found a specimen which he believed to be over 80 years old.</p>

<p>This is called by many authors Polyporus igniarius (L.), Fr. Murrill calls
it Pyropolyporus igniarius. This plant is widely distributed over the United
States, and is met frequently in every wood in Ohio.</p>

<p>Fraxinophilus means ash-loving; rather common in this country, but does
not grow in Europe.</p>

<p>The pileus is between corky and woody, smooth, somewhat flattened, at first
zoneless; white when young, then reddish-brown, white around the margin; at
first even, then concentrically sulcate, pale within.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span></p>

<p>The tubes are short, pores minute, rusty-red but covered from the first with a
white pubescence and continuous with the margin; the spores nearly
round, 6&ndash;7Âµ.</p>

<p>The specimens in Figure 350 were found in Haynes' Hollow on a living ash,
growing at intervals of five or six feet, one above another, to a height of thirty feet.</p>


<h3><i>Trametes. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>In case of the genus Trametes the hymenophorum descends into the trama
of the pores without any change, and is permanently concrete with the pileus.
The pores are entire. There are, however, a few of the Polypori which are quite
thin that have the trama of the same structure with the hymenophorum. These
have been separated by Fries and have been called <i>Polystictus</i>. They are distinguished
by the fact that the pores develop from the center out and are perpendicular
to the fibrillose stratum above the hymenophorum while in the genus
<i>Trametes</i> the hymenophorum is not distant from the rest of the pileus.</p>

<p>This is one of the neatest
plants of this structure in our
woods. It grows on the small
branches and many times covers
them quite well. It is resupinate,
the cap being beautifully
zoned as you see in Figure
351. Frequently they grow from
the side of a small tree that
has fallen to the ground and
in this case they are shelving.</p>

<p>The pore surface is usually
reddish or flesh-color, the pores
being long and irregular and
inclined to be labyrinthiform
in older specimens as will be
seen in Figure 352.</p>

<p>The whole plant is reddish or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
pale flesh-color. No one will
fail to recognize it from
these cuts.</p>


<h3><i>Trametes scutellata. Schw.</i></h3>

<p>Scutellata means shield-bearing.
It is frequently quite
small, an inch or less; coriaceous,
dimidiate, orbiculate or
ungulate, fixed by the apex;
the pilei quite hard: white,
then brownish and blackish, becoming rugged and uneven, with white margin;
hymenium disk-shaped, concave, white-pulverulent becoming dark; pores minute,
long, with thick obtuse dissepiments. This is found on fence posts.</p>


<h3><i>Trametes Ohiensis. Berk.</i></h3>

<p>The pilei are pulvinate, narrow, zoned, often laterally confluent; ochraceous-white,
tomentose, then smooth, laccate. This plant resembles T. scutellata in
many points, both in habit and in form.</p>


<h3><i>Trametes suaveolens. (L.) Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Soft at first, pulvinate, white, villous, zoneless; pores rotund, rather large,
obtuse, white, then darker; anise-scented. Found on willows.</p>


<h3><i>Merulius. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Merulius means a blackbird; from the color of the fungus.</p>

<p>Hymenophore covered with the soft waxy hymenium, which is incompletely
porus, or arranged in reticulate, sinuous, dentate folds. This genus grows on
wood, at first resupinate, expanded; the hymenophore springing from a mucous
mycelium.</p>

<p>Rubellus is the diminutive of <i>ruber</i>, reddish. The pileus grows in tufts,
sessile, confluent and imbricated, repand, thin, convex, soft, dimidiate, quite
tenacious; tomentose, evenly red, margin mostly undulately inflexed, growing
pale in age. Hymenium whitish or reddish, folds much branched, forming
anastomosing pores. The spores are elliptical, hyaline, minute, 4&ndash;5Ã—2.5&ndash;3Âµ. The
pileus is two to three inches long and an inch and a half broad.</p>

<p>It is found very frequently on decayed beech and sugar trees and I have found
it growing on a live oak. The specimens in Figure 353 were collected near
Columbus and photographed by Dr. Kellerman. It is probably the same as M.
incarnati, Schw.</p>

<p>Tremellosus, trembling. Resupinate; margin becoming free and more or
less reflexed, usually radiately-toothed, fleshy, tremelloid, tomentose, white;
hymenium variously wrinkled and porus, whitish and subtranslucent-looking,
becoming tinged with brown in the center. The spores are cylindrical, curved,
about 4Ã—1Âµ. From one to three inches across, remaining pale when growing in
dark places. The margin is sometimes tinged with a rose-color, radiating when
it is well developed. <i>Massee.</i></p>

<p>This plant grows in woods on wood and is quite common in our woods&mdash;both
the rose-colored and the translucent-brown. Captain McIlvaine calls Merulius
tremellosus and M. rubellus emergency species. He says they are rather
tasteless, tough, slightly woody in flavor. They are found in October and
November.</p>


<h3><i>Merulius corium. Fr.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span></h3>

<p>Resupinate, effused, soft, papery, circumference at length free, reflexed,
white, villous below. Hymenium netted, porus, pallid, tan-color.</p>

<p>Found on decaying-branches. Quite common.</p>


<h3><i>Merulius lacrymans. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Resupinate, fleshy, spongy, moist, tender, at first very light, cottony and
white; when the veins appear they are of a fine yellow, orange or reddish-brown,
forming irregular folds, so arranged to have the appearance of pores (but never
anything like tubes), distilling when perfect drops of water which give rise to the
specific name "weeping."</p>

<p>Dr. Charles W. Hoyt of Chillicothe, brought to my office two or three plants
of this species that had grown on the under side of the floor in his wash-house.
When he took up the floor the workmen discovered a number of pendant processes,
some oval, some cone-shaped. Some were eight inches long, very white and
beautiful but clearly illustrating the weeping process. The doctor called them
white rats suspended by their tails.</p>


<h3><i>DÃ¦dalea. Pers.</i></h3>

<p>DÃ¦dalea is used with reference to the labyrinthiform pores; so named after
DÃ¦dalos, the builder of the labyrinth of Crete.</p>

<p>The hymenophore descends into the trama without any change, pores firm,
when fully grown sinuous and labyrinthiform, lacerated, and toothed. The habits
of DÃ¦dalea are very much the same as Trametes, but they are inodorous. Care
should be taken not to confound them with the species of Polyporus that have
elongated curved pores.</p>

<p>The pileus is white, corky, horizontal, explanate, reniform, subsessile, azonate,
finely pubescent, becoming smooth.</p>

<p>Pores from round to linear and labyrinthiform, the dissepiments always
obtuse and never lamellate.</p>

<p>It is a very common growth in Ohio, found on old logs of the sugar maple.
You will see the beginning of the growth in the spring as a round white nodule<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
which develops slowly. If the
same plant is observed in the
summer it will be found to be
gibbous or convex in form. It
finishes its growth in the fall
when it has become explanate
and horizontal, depressed above
and with a thin margin. When
fresh and growing it is of a rich
cream-color and has a soft and
velvety touch and a pleasant
fragrance. In Figure 355, showing
the surface of the cap, the
growth of the plant shows in
the form of the zones. Figure
356 shows the form of the
dissepiments. In younger specimens
these are frequently
round, much like a Polyporus.
There is one locality in Poke
Hollow where the maple logs
are white with this species, appearing,
in the distance, to be
oyster mushrooms.</p>

thin, but in imperfectly developed specimens swollen and blunt.</p>

<p>The pores are at first round, then broken into contorted or gill-like labyrinthiform
sinuses, with obtuse edges of the same color as the pileus, sometimes with
a slight shade of pink.</p>

<p>They grow to be very large, from six to eight inches broad, being found
on oak stumps and logs, though not as common in Ohio as D. ambigua. The

<h3><i>DÃ¦dalea unicolor. Fr.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span></h3>

<p>Villose-strigose, cinereous with concolorous zones; hymenium with flexuous,
winding, intricate, acute dissepiments, at length torn and toothed. The pores are
whitish cinereous, sometimes fuscous; variable in thickness, color, and character
of hymenium; sometimes with white margin; often imbricated and fuliginous
when moist. Widely distributed over the states and found on nearly all deciduous
trees.</p>

</div>

<p>Confragosa means broken, rough. The pileus is rather convex, corky, rough,
slightly zonate, reddish-brown, unicolorous, somewhat of a rust-red within.</p>

<p>The pores are frequently round, like those of the Polyporus, but sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
they are elongated into
gills like the Lenzites;
reddish-brown.</p>

<p>I have seen quite old
specimens that were very
difficult to distinguish
from some of the forms
of Lenzites. The young
plants resemble very
closely Trametes rubescens.
It grows on
CratÃ¦gus, willow and
sometimes on other
trees, and is widely distributed.
The specimen
in Figure 358 was found
in Massachusetts by Mrs.
Blackford, and photographed
in my study.</p>


<h3><i>Favolus. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Favolus is a diminutive of <i>favus</i>, honey-comb.</p>

<p>The hymenium is alveolate, radiating, formed of the densely irregularly
uniting gills; elongated, diamond-shaped. Spores white. Semicircular in outline,
somewhat stipitate.</p>


<h3><i>Favolus canadensis. Klotsch.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span></h3>

<p>The pileus is fleshy, tough, thin, kidney-form, fibrillose, scaly, tawny, becoming
pale and smooth.</p>

<p>The pores or alveoli are angular elongated, white at first, then straw-color.</p>

<p>The stem is eccentric, lateral, very short or lacking altogether.</p>

<p>This plant is very common around Chillicothe on fallen branches in the
woods, especially on hickory. Found from September to frost. Not poisonous
but too tough to eat. I do not believe there is any difference between F.
canadensis and Favolus Europeus. I notice that our plant assumes different
colors in different stages of its growth, and the form of the pores also
changes.</p>


<h3><i>Cyclomyces. Kunz &amp; Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Cyclomyces is from two Greek words, meaning a circle and fungus. This
genus is very distinct from other tube-bearing genera. The pileus is fleshy,
leathery or membranaceous, and usually cushion-formed. Upon the lower surface
are the plate-like bodies resembling the gills of Agarics but which are composed
of minute pores. These pore bodies are arranged in concentric circles around
the stem.</p>


<h3><i>Cyclomyces Greenii. Berk.</i></h3>

</div>

<p>The pileus is two to three inches broad,
globose at first, convex, sometimes undulate,
somewhat zoned, tomentose, dry, cushion-formed,
cinnamon-brown, rather showy.</p>

<p>The gills are in concentric circles around the
stem, growing larger and larger as they reach
the margin of the cap. In the young plant the
gills are divided into long divisions but in
the older plant these division lines disappear
as will be seen in Figure 361. The edges of
the gills are white at first, as will be seen in
Figure 361, but finally becoming cinnamon-brown.</p>

<p>The stem is central, tapering upward, quite
large and swollen at times very much like
Hydnum spongiosipes; the color is the same as
the pileus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span></p>

<p>This is a very
interesting plant
and quite rare in
Ohio, however,
I found several
plants in the fall
of 1905, on
Ralston's Run.
In the same locality
I found
Boletus badius,
and when I first
saw C. Greenii I
came near mistaking
it for the
same plant and
so neglecting it,
the caps being
at first glance so
much alike.</p>


<h3><i>Gl&oelig;oporus. Mont.</i></h3>

<p>Gl&oelig;oporus is from two Greek words, meaning gluten and pore. The plants
of this genus resemble the polyporus and are frequently placed under that genus.</p>


<h3><i>Gl&oelig;oporus conchoides. Mont.</i></h3>

<p>Conchoides means like a shell.</p>

<p>The pileus is leathery or woody, at first fleshy, soft, effused, with upper
margin reflexed; thin, silky, whitish, with edge of the margin often reddish. It
has a trembling, gelatinous, spore-bearing surface, often somewhat elastic.</p>

<p>The pores are short, very small, round, cinnamon-brown.</p>

<p>There are several synonyms. Polyporus dichrous, Fr., and P. nigropurpurascens,
Schw. Montgomery places it in the above genus because of its gelatinous
hymenium.</p>

HYDNACEAE&mdash;FUNGI WITH TEETH.</h2>


<p>There is, perhaps, no family in mycology that has a greater variety in form,
size, and consistency than this. Some species are very large, some are small,
some fleshy, and some are corky or woody. The fruiting surface is the special
characteristic marking the family. This surface is covered with spines or teeth
which nearly always point to the earth.</p>

<p>Many of the HydnaceÃ¦ are shelving, growing on trees or logs; some grow
on the ground on central, but usually eccentric, stems. The genera of HydnaceÃ¦
are distinguished by the size, shape, and attachment of the teeth. The following
genera are included:</p>


<ul>
<li>  Hydnum&mdash;Spines discrete at the base.</li>
<li>  Irpex&mdash;Resupinate; with gill-like teeth concrete with the pileus.</li>
<li>  Mucronella&mdash;Plants with teeth only and no basal membrane.</li>
<li>  Radulum&mdash;Hymenium with thick, blunt, irregular spines.</li>
<li>  Sistotrema&mdash;Fleshy plants with caps and flattened teeth, on ground.</li>
<li>  Phlebia&mdash;Plants spread over the host with crowded folds or wrinkles.</li>
<li>  Grandinia&mdash;Covered with granules, more or less smooth, and excavated.</li>
<li>  Odontium&mdash;Covered with crested granules.</li>
</ul>


<h3><i>Hydnum. Linn.</i></h3>

<p>Hydnum is from a Greek word meaning an eatable fungus. The genus is
characterized by awl-shaped spines which are distant at the base. These spines
are at first papilliform, then elongated and round. They form the fruiting surface
and take the place of the gills in the family AgaricaceÃ¦ and of the pores in the
family of PolyporaceÃ¦. The spines are simple or in some cases the tips are more
or less branched.</p>

<p>This is the greatest genus in the family and it includes many important edible
species. It may be divided into two groups: one, those species having a cap and
a central or lateral stem; the other, the species growing with or without a distinct
cap, in large imbricated masses. Some imitate coral in structure and some seem
to be a mass of spines. Many of these plants grow to be very large and massive,
frequently weighing over ten pounds.</p>

</div>

<p>Repandum, bent backward, referring to the position of the stem and the cap.
The pileus is two to four inches broad, generally irregular, with the stem eccentric;
fleshy, brittle, convex or nearly plane, compact, more or less repand, nearly
smooth; color varying from a pale buff&mdash;the typical hue&mdash;to a distinct brick-red;
flesh creamy-white, inclining to turn brown when bruised; taste slightly aromatic,
margin often wavy.</p>

<p>The spines are beneath the cap, one-quarter to one-third of an inch long,
irregular, entire, pointed, rather easily detached, leaving small cavities in the
fleshy cap, soft, creamy, becoming darker in older specimens.</p>

<p>The stem is short, thick, solid in young specimens, hollow in older specimens;
paler than the pileus, rather rough, often set eccentrically into the cap; one to
three inches long, sometimes thickened at the base, sometimes at the top. The
spores are globose or a broad oval, with a small papilla at one end.</p>

<p>The usual color of the cap is buff, sometimes very pale, almost white. The
color and smoothness of the cap have given rise to the name of "doe-skin
mushroom." I found this plant occasionally in the woods about Salem, Ohio. It
is very variable in size and color, and is quite fragile, growing alone or in clusters.
It is one of our best mushrooms if properly cooked, and may be dried and kept
for winter use. Found in woods and open places from July to October, sometimes
earlier. Specimens in Figure 362 were found in Poke Hollow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Imbricated Hydnum. Edible.</span></p>

<p>Imbricatum is from <i>imbrex</i>, a tile, referring to the surface of the cap being
torn into triangular scales, seeming to overlap one another like shingles on a roof.</p>

<p>The pileus is fleshy, plane, slightly depressed, tessellated scaly, downy, not
zoned, umber in color or brownish as if scorched, flesh dingy-white, taste slightly
bitter when raw, margin round.</p>

<p>The spines are decurrent, entire, numerous, short, ashy-white, generally
equal in length.</p>

<p>The stem is firm, short, thick, even, whitish. The spores are pale yellow-brown,
rough.</p>

<p>The bitter taste entirely leaves the plant when well cooked. It seems to
delight in pine or chestnut woods. I found it in Emmanuel Thomas' woods, east of
Salem, Ohio. It is found from September to November.</p>

inches to four inches long, crowded, straight, equal, pendulous. The stem is sometimes
rudimentary. The spores are subglobose, white, plain, 5&ndash;6Âµ. <i>Peck</i>, 22 N. Y.
Report.</p>

<p>The spines when just starting are like small papillÃ¦, as will be seen in
Figure 364. Figure 363 represents a very fine specimen found on the end of a
beech log, on the Huntington Hills, near Chillicothe. It made a meal for three
families. I have found several basketfuls of this species on this same log, within
the past few years. I have also found on the same log large specimens of Hydnum
corralloides.</p>

<p>The photograph at the beginning of the book represents the largest specimen
I ever saw of this species. It measured eighteen inches one way and thirteen the
other, and was found on a maple tree on top of Mount Logan. It grew from a
central stem, while the one in Figure 363 grew from a crack in a log, apparently
without a stem. Plate I, Figure 1 was photographed after it was dried. The
specimen can be seen in the Lloyd Library in Cincinnati. Found from July to
October.</p>

<p>Caput-ursi means the head of a bear.</p>

<p>This is a very beautiful plant but not as common as some other species of
Hydnum. It grows in very large pendulous tufts, as Figure 365 will indicate. It
is found frequently on standing oak and maple trees, sometimes quite high up in
the trees. It is more frequently found on logs and stumps, as are its kindred
species. The plant arises out of the wood by a single stout stem which branches
into many divisions, all of which are covered by long pendant spines. When it
grows on top of a log or stump the spines are frequently erect. It is white,
becoming in age
yellow and
brownish. It has
a wide distribution
through the
states. As an esculent
it is fine.
The specimen in
Figure 365 was
found near Akron,
Ohio, and
was photographed
by Mr. G. D.
Smith. It is
found from July
to October.</p>

<p>Caput-MedusÃ¦,
head of Medusa.
This is a very
striking plant
when seen in the
woods. The tufts
are pendulous.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
The long wavy spines resemble the wavy locks of Medusa, hence the name. The
long soft spines cover the entire surface of the fungus, which is divided into
fleshy branches or divisions, each terminating in a crown of shorter drooping
teeth.</p>

<p>The color at first is white, changing in age to a buff or a dark cream, which
distinguishes it from H. caput-ursi. The taste is sweet and aromatic, sometimes
slightly pungent. The stem is short and concealed beneath the growth.</p>

<p>I found this plant growing on a hickory log, on Lee's hill, near
Chillicothe, from which came the specimen in Figure 366. I have also found it on
elm and beech. Found from July to October.</p>

<p>It is both attractive and palatable.</p>

<p>This species grows in large, beautiful tufts on decaying logs, in damp woods.
It grows from a common stem, dividing into many branches and then sub-dividing
into many long and coral-like shoots, composed wholly of attenuated interlacing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 439]<br />[Pg 440]</a></span>
branches tapering to a point. The spines grow from one side of the flattened
branches. It only needs to be seen once to be recognized as a coral-like mushroom.
It is pure white at first, becoming creamy or dingy-white with age. It
seems to delight in damp, hilly places, yet I found it to be abundant at Sidney,
and to some extent about Bowling Green, Ohio, where it was very level. It is
plentiful around Chillicothe. One hickory log, from which the specimen in the
figure was taken, furnished me several basketfuls of this plant during three
seasons, but at the end of the third season the log crumbled away, mycelium
having literally consumed it. It is one of the most beautiful fungi that Dame
Nature has been able to fashion. It is said that Elias Fries, when a mere boy,
was so impressed with the sight of this beautiful fungus, which grew abundantly
in his native woods in Sweden, that he resolved when he grew up to pursue the
study of Mycology, which he did; and became one of the greatest authorities of
the world in that part of Botany. In fact, he laid the foundation for the study
of Basidiomycetes, and this beautiful little coral-like fungus was his inspiration.</p>

<p>It is found principally on beech, maple and hickory in damp woods, from
July to frost. I have eaten it for years and esteem it among the best.</p>

<p>There are many pilei growing one above the other, plane, margin straight,
whole. The spines are crowded, slender and equal.</p>

<p>I have found a number of specimens about Chillicothe that would weigh

<p>The stem is hard and corky within, externally spongy-tomentose; colored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
like the pileus, the central substance often transversely zoned, especially near the
top. Spores globose, nodulose, purplish-brown, 4&ndash;6 broad. Pileus one and a
half to four inches broad. Stem one and a half to three inches long, and four
to eight lines thick. <i>Peck</i>, 50th Rep.</p>

<p>It is found in the woods, quite plentifully, about Chillicothe. I referred it
to H. ferrugineum for a long time, but not being satisfied, sent some specimens
to Dr. Peck, who classified it as H. spongiosipes. It is edible but very tough.

<p>The spore-bearing spines are shown in the upper plants in Figure 370. Two
of them show coalesced caps, though the stems are separate. This is the case

<p>This species is very plentiful
in our woods, among the leaves
under beech trees. They grow
in lines for some distance, the
caps so close together that they
are very frequently confluent.
I found the plant at Salem, and
in several other localities in the

<p>Adustum means
scorched, burned.
The pileus is two to
three inches broad,
yellowish-white,
blackish around the
margin, coriaceous, slightly zoned; plane at first, then slightly depressed; tomen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>tose,
thin; frequently a plant will be found growing on the top of another plant.
The spines are at first white, adnate, short, turning flesh-color and when
dried almost black.</p>

<p>The stem is short, solid, tapering upward.</p>

<p>The plant is found growing in the woods on trunks and sticks after a rain
in July, August, and September. It is not as plentiful as Hydnum spongiosipes
and H. scrobiculatum. It is an attractive plant when seen in the woods.</p>


<h3><i>Hydnum ochraceum. P.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Ochrey Hydnum.</span></p>

<p>Small, at first entirely resupinate, gradually reflexed, and somewhat repand,
at first sparingly clothed with dirty-white down, at length rugose; one to three

</div>

<p>Pulcherrimum is the superlative of <i>pulcher</i>, beautiful.</p>

<p>The pileus is fleshy, somewhat fibrous, alutaceus, hirsute; the margin thin,
entire, incurved.</p>

<p>The aculei short, crowded, equal.</p>

<p>It is found on beech wood, frequently imbricated and laterally confluent; a
single pileus two to five inches in breadth and projecting two to four inches. The
spines are rather short, not exceeding a quarter of an inch.</p>

<p>The entire plant is quite fibrous and has a hirsute surface. The color varies
from whitish to alutaceous and yellowish. It is not common with us. Figure 375
represents one of the pilei showing the spines.</p>


<h3><i>Hydnum graveolens. Del.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fragrant Hydnum.</span></p>

<p>Graveolens means sweet-scented.</p>

<p>The pileus is coriaceous, thin, soft, not zoned, rugose, dark-brown, brown
within, margin becoming whitish. The stem is slender and the spines are decurrent.
The spines are short, gray.</p>

<p>The whole plant smells of melilot; even after it has been dried and kept for
years it does not lose this scent.</p>

<p>I found two specimens in Haynes's Hollow.</p>


<h3><i>Irpex. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Irpex, a harrow, so called from a fancied resemblance of its teeth to the
teeth of a harrow. It grows on wood; toothed from the first, the teeth are
connected at the base, firm, somewhat coriaceous, concrete with the pileus,
arranged in rows or like net-work. Irpex differs from Hydnum in having the
spines connected at the base and more blunt.</p>


<h3><i>Irpex carneus. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>This plant, as its specific name indicates, resembles the color of flesh. Reddish,
effused, one to three inches long, cartilaginous-gelatinous, membranaceous,
adnate. Teeth obtuse and awl-shaped, entire, united at the base. <i>Fries.</i></p>

<p>Found on the tulip-tree, hickory, and elm. September and October.</p>


<h3><i>Irpex lacteus. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Growing on wood, membranaceous, clothed with stiff hair, more or less
furrowed, milk-white, as its specific name indicates.</p>

<p>The spines are compressed, radiate, margin porus. Found on hickory and
beech logs and stumps.</p>

teeth springing from a porus base, somewhat coriaceous, entirely concrete with the
pileus, netted and connected at the base, white or whitish, turning yellowish with
age.</p>

<p>This plant is very abundant here on fallen tulip trees. I have seen entire
tree tops and trunks covered with this plant. The branches after they have
been penetrated with the mycelial threads become very light and brittle.</p>


<h3><i>Phlebia. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Lignatile, resupinate, hymenium soft and waxy, covered with folds or
wrinkles, edges entire or corrugated.</p>

<p>The spores are cylindric-oblong, curved, 4&ndash;5Ã—1&ndash;1.5Âµ.</p>

<p>This is quite common on beech bark in the woods. Its bright color and mode
of growth will attract attention.</p>


<h3><i>Grandinia. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Lignatile, effused, waxy, granulated, granules globular, entire, permanent.</p>

THELEPHORACEAE.</h2>


<p>ThelephoraceÃ¦ is from two Greek words, a teat and to bear. The hymenium
is even, coriaceous, or waxy, costate, or papillose. There are a number of genera
under this family but I am acquainted with only the genus Craterellus.</p>


<h3><i>Craterellus. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Craterellus means a small bowl. Hymenium waxy-membranaceous, distinct
but adnate to the hymenophore, inferior, continuous, smooth, even or wrinkled.
Spores white. <i>Fries.</i></p>


<h3><i>Craterellus cantharellus.</i> (<i>Schw.</i>) <i>Fr.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Yellow Craterellus. Edible.</span></p>

  </a>
  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 378.</span>&mdash;Craterellus cantharellus. Caps and stems yellow.</p>
</div>

<p>Cantharellus is a diminutive from a Greek word meaning a sort of drinking-cup.</p>

<p>The pileus is one to three inches broad, convex, often becoming depressed
and funnel-shaped, glabrous, yellowish, or pinkish. Flesh white, tough, elastic.</p>

<p>Hymenium slightly wrinkled, yellow or faint salmon color.</p>

<p>The stem is one to three inches high, tapering downward, smooth, solid, yellow.
The spores are yellowish or salmon color when caught on white paper,
7.5&ndash;10Ã—5&ndash;6Âµ. <i>Peck.</i></p>

<p>This plant resembles Cantharellus cibarius very closely. The color, form
of growth, and the odor are very similar to the latter. It may be readily
distinguished from C. cibarius by the absence of folds on the under or fruiting
surface. The caps are often large and wavy, resembling yellow cauliflower.
It is quite abundant about Chillicothe during the months of July and August.
I have frequently gathered bushels of it for my mushroom-friends. It will be
easily recognized from Figure 378, bearing in mind that the caps and stems are
yellow.</p>


<h3><i>Craterellus cornucopioides
Fr.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Horn of Plenty
Craterellus. Edible.</span></p>

  </a>
  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 379.</span>&mdash;Craterellus cornucopioides. One-third natural size.</p>
</div>

<p>Cornucopioides is from
<i>cornu</i>, a horn, and <i>copia</i>,
plenty.</p>

<p>The pileus is thin, flexible,
tubiform, hollow to
the base, blackish-brown,
sometimes a little scaly,
the hymenium even or
somewhat wrinkled,
cinereous.</p>

<p>The stem is hollow,
smooth, black, short, almost
wanting. The spores
are elliptical, whitish,
11&ndash;12Ã—7&ndash;8Âµ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span></p>

<p>No one will have any trouble in recognizing this species, having once seen
its picture and read its description. Its elongated or trumpet-shaped cap, and
its dingy-gray or sooty-brown hue, will at once distinguish it. The spore-bearing
surface is often a little paler than the upper surface. The cup is often three
to four inches long. I have found it in quite large clusters in the woods near
Bowling Green, and Londonderry, though it is found rather sparingly on the
hillsides about Chillicothe. It has a wide distribution in other states. It does not
look inviting, on account of its color, but it proves a favorite whenever tested, and
may be dried and kept for future use. It is found from July to September.</p>

  </a>
  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 380.</span>&mdash;Craterellus dubius. Natural
size.</p>
</div>

<p>Dubius means uncertain, from its close resemblance
to C. cornucopoides.</p>

<p>The pileus is one to two inches broad,
infundibuliform, subfibrillose, lurid-brown,
pervious to the base, the margin generally
wavy, lobed. Hymenium dark cinereous,
rugose when moist, the minute crowded irregular
folds abundantly anastomosing; nearly
even when dry. The stem is short. The
spores are broadly elliptical or subglobose,
6&ndash;7.5Âµ long. <i>Peck.</i></p>

<p>It differs from C. cornucopioides in manner
of growth, paler color, and smaller spores.</p>

<p>It is distinguished from Craterellus sinuosus
by its pervious stem, while very similar
in color to Cantharellus cinereus.</p>

<p>This plant, like C. cornucopoides, dries
readily, and when moistened expands and
becomes quite as good as when fresh. It
needs to be stewed slowly till tender, when it
makes a delightful dish.</p>

<p>The plants in Figure 380 were collected near Columbus by R. H. Young and
photographed by Dr. Kellerman. They are found from July to October.</p>


<h3><i>Corticium. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Entirely resupinate, hymenium soft and fleshy when moist, collapsing when
dry, often cracked.</p>


<h3><i>Corticium lacteum. Fr.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span></h3>

<p>This is a very small plant, resupinate, membranaceous, and it is so named
because of the milk-white color underneath. The hymenium is waxy when moist,
cracked when dry.</p>


<h3><i>Corticium oakesii. B. &amp; C.</i></h3>

<p>The plant is small, waxy-pliant, somewhat coriaceous, cup-shaped, then explanate,
confluent, marginate, externally white-tomentose.</p>

<p>The hymenium is even, contiguous, becoming pallid. Spores elliptical, appendiculate.</p>

<p>I found very fine specimens of this plant on the Iron-wood, Ostrya Virginica,
which grows on the high school lawn in Chillicothe. In rainy weather in October
and November the bark would be white with the plant. It resembles a small
Peziza at first.</p>


<h3><i>Corticium incarnatum. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Waxy when moist, becoming rigid when dry, confluent, agglutinate, radiating.
Hymenium red or flesh-color, covered with a delicate flesh-colored bloom. Some
fine specimens were found on dead chestnut trees in Poke Hollow.</p>


<h3><i>Corticium sambucum. Pk.</i></h3>

<p>Effused on elder bark, white, continuous when growing, when dry cracked
or flocculose and collapsing. It grows on the bark or the wood of the elder.</p>


<h3><i>Corticium cinereum. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Waxy when moist, rigid when dry, agglutinate, lurid. The hymenium is
cinereous, with a very delicate bloom. Common on sticks in the woods.</p>


<h3><i>Thelephora. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>The pileus is without a cuticle, consisting of interwoven fibres. Hymenium
ribbed, of a tough, fleshy substance, rather rigid, then collapsing and flocculent.</p>

</div>

<p>Schweinitzii is named in
honor of the Rev. David
Lewis de Schweinitz. CÃ¦spitose,
white or pallid.
Pilei soft-corinaceous, much
branched; the branches flattened,
furrowed and somewhat
dilated at the apex.</p>

<p>The stems are variable in
length, often connate or
fused together into a solid
base.</p>

<p>The hymenium is even,
becoming darker colored
when older. <i>Morgan.</i></p>

<p>This plant is known as T.
pallida. It is very abundant on our hillsides in Ross County, and in fact throughout
the state.</p>


<h3><i>Thelephora laciniata. P.</i></h3>

<p>The pileus is soft, somewhat coriaceous, incrusting, ferruginous-brown. The
pilei are imbricated, fibrous, scaly, margin fimbriated, at first dirty white. The
hymenium is inferior and papillose.</p>


<h3><i>Thelephora palmata. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>The pileus is coriaceous, soft, erect, palmately branched from a common
stalk; pubescent, purplish-brown; branches flat, even, tips fimbriated, whitish. The
scent is very noticeable soon after it is picked. They grow on the ground in
July and August.</p>


<h3><i>Thelephora cristata. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>The pileus is incrusting, rather tough, pallid, passing into branches, the
apices compressed, expanded, and beautifully fringed. The plant is whitish,
grayish, or purplish-brown. It is found on moss or stems of weeds. I found
beautiful specimens at Bainbridge Caves.</p>


<h3><i>Thelephora sebacea. Fr.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span></h3>

<p>The pileus is effused, fleshy, waxy, becoming hard, incrusting, variable,
tuberculose or stalactitic, whitish, circumference similar; hymenium flocculose,
pruinose, or evanescent.</p>

<p>It is found effused over grass. One meets with it often.</p>


<h3><i>Stereum. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>The hymenium is coriaceous,
even, rather thick, concrete
with the intermediate
stratum of the pileus, which
has a cuticle even and veinless,
remaining unchanged
and smooth.</p>


<h3><i>Stereum versicolor.</i></h3>

  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 382.</span>&mdash;Stereum versicolor.</p>
</div>

<p>Versicolor means changing
color, referring to the different
bands of color. The
pileus is effused, reflexed,
having a number of different
zones; in some plants the
zones are more marked than
in others, the zones appearing
very much like those in
Polyporus versicolor.</p>

<p>The hymenium is even, smooth and brown.</p>

<p>This is a very common plant, found everywhere on old logs and stumps. It is
widely diffused and can be found at any time of the year.</p>


<h3><i>Stereum spadiceum. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Pilei coriaceous and spreading, reflexed, villous, somewhat ferruginous;
margin rather obtuse, whitish, even beneath; smooth, brownish, and bleeding
when scratched or bruised.</p>


<h3><i>Stereum hirsutum. Fr.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span></h3>

<p>Hirsutum means shaggy, hairy. The pilei are coriaceous and spreading,
quite hairy, imbricated, more or less zoned, quite tough, often having a greenish
tinge from the presence of a minute algÃ¦; naked, juiceless, yellowish, unchanged
when bruised or scratched. The hymenium is pale-yellow, smooth, margin entire,
often lobed. I find it usually on hickory logs.</p>


<h3><i>Stereum fasciatum. Schw.</i></h3>

<p>Fasciatum means bands or fillets. Pileus is coriaceous, plane, villous,
zonate, grayish; hymenium, smooth,
pale-red. Growing on decayed
trunks. Common in all of our
woods.</p>


<h3><i>Stereum sericeum. Schw.</i></h3>

<p>Sericeum means silky or satiny;
so called from its satin lustre. The
plant is very small and easily overlooked,
usually growing in a resupinate
form; sessile, orbiculate,
free, papyraceous, with a bright
satin lustre, shining, smooth, pale-grayish
color.</p>

<p>The plant grows on both sides of
small twigs as is shown in the
photograph. I do not find it on
large trunks but it is quite common
on branches. No one will fail
to recognize it from its specific
name.</p>

<p>When I first observed it I
named it S. sericeum, not knowing
that there was a species by
that name. I afterwards sent
it to Prof. Atkinson and was
surprised to find that I had correctly
named it.</p>


<h3><i>Stereum rugosum. Fr.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span></h3>

<p>Rugosum means full of wrinkles.</p>

<p>Broadly effused, sometimes shortly reflexed; coriaceous, at length thick and
rigid; pileus at length smooth, brownish.</p>

<p>The hymenium is a pale grayish-yellow, changing slightly to a red when
bruised, pruinose. The spores are cylindrico-elliptical, straight, 11&ndash;12Ã—4&ndash;5Âµ.
<i>Massee.</i></p>

<p>This is quite variable in form, and agrees with S. sanguinolentum in becoming
red when bruised; but it is thicker and more rigid in substance, its pores are
straighter and larger.</p>


<h3><i>Stereum purpureum. Pers.</i></h3>

<p>Purpureum means purple, from the color of the plant.</p>

<p>Coriaceous but pliant, effuso-reflexed, more or less imbricated, tomentose,
zoned, whitish or pallid.</p>

<p>The hymenium is naked, smooth, even; in color a pale clear purple, becoming
dingy ochraceous, with only a tinge of purple, when dry. The spores are elliptical,
7&ndash;8Ã—4Âµ.</p>

<p>I found the plant to be very abundant in December and January, in 1906&ndash;7, on
soft wood corded up at the paper mill in Chillicothe, the weather being mild and
damp.</p>


<h3><i>Stereum compactum.</i></h3>

<p>Broadly effused, coriaceous, often imbricated and often laterally joined, pileus
thin, zoned, finely strigose, the zones grayish-white and cinnamon-brown.</p>

<p>The hymenium is smooth, cream-white.</p>

<p>This species is found on decayed limbs and trunks of trees.</p>


<h3><i>HymenochÃ¦te. Lev.</i></h3>

<p>HymenochÃ¦te is from two Greek words, <i>hymen</i>, a membrane; <i>chÃ¦te</i>, a bristle.</p>

<p>In this genus the cap or pileus may be attached to the host by a central stem,
or at one side, but most frequently upon its back. The genus is known by the
velvety or bristly appearance of the fruiting surface, due to smooth, projecting,
thick-walled cells. I have found several species but have only been sure of three.</p>


<h3><i>HymenochÃ¦te rubiginosa. (Schr.) Lev.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span></h3>

<p>Rubiginosa means full of rust, so called from the color of the plant.</p>

<p>The pileus is rigid, coriaceous, resupinate, effused, reflexed, the lower margin
generally adhering firmly, somewhat fasciated; velvety, rubiginous or rusty in
color, then becoming smooth and bright brown, the intermediate stratum tawny-ferruginous.
The hymenium ferruginous and velvety. It is found here upon soft
woods such as chestnut stumps and willow.</p>


<h3><i>HymenochÃ¦te Curtisii. Berk.</i></h3>

<p>Curtisii is named in honor of Mr. Curtis.</p>

<p>The pileus is coriaceous, firm, resupinate, effused, reflexed, brown, slightly
sulcate; the hymenium velvety with brown bristles. This is common on partially
decayed oak branches in the woods.</p>


<h3><i>HymenochÃ¦te corrugata. Berk.</i></h3>

<p>Corrugata means bearing wrinkles or folds.</p>

<p>The pileus is coriaceous, effused, closely adnate, indeterminate, cinnamon
colored, cracked and corrugated when dry, which gives rise to its name. The
bristles are seen, under the microscope, to be joined. Found in the woods on
partially decayed branches.</p>

CLAVARIACEAE&mdash;CORAL FUNGI.</h2>


<p>Hymenium not distinct from the hymenophore, covering entire outer surface,
somewhat fleshy, not coriaceous; vertical, simple or branched. <i>Fries.</i></p>

<p>Most of the species grow on the ground or on well rotted logs. The following
genera are included here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sparassis&mdash;Fleshy, much branched, branches compressed, plate-like.</li>

<li>Clavaria&mdash;Fleshy, simple or branched, typically round.</li>

<li>Calocera&mdash;Gelatinous, then horn-like.</li>

<li>Typhula&mdash;Simple or club-shaped, rigid when dry, usually small.</li>
</ul>

<h3><i>Sparassis. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Sparassis, to tear in pieces. The species are fleshy, branched with plate-like
branches, composed of two plates, fertile on both sides.</p>


<h3><i>Sparassis Herbstii. Pk.</i></h3>

  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 384.</span>&mdash;Sparassis Herbstii.</p>
</div>

<p>This is a plant very much branched, forming tufts four to five inches high,
and five to six inches broad; whitish, inclining to creamy-yellow; tough, moist;
the branches numerous, thin, flattened, concrescent, dilated above, spathulate or
fan-shaped, often somewhat longitudinally curved or wavy; mostly uniformly
colored, rarely with a few indistinct, nearly concolorous, transverse zones near the
broad, entire apices.</p>

<p>The spores are globose, or broadly elliptical, .0002 to .00025 inch long, .00016
to .0002 broad.</p>

<p>This species was first found by the late Dr. William Herbst of Trexlertown,
Pa., and was named by Dr. Peck in his honor. The specimen in Figure 384 was
found at Trexlertown, Pa., and photographed by Mr. C. G. Lloyd. The plant
delights in open oak woods, and is found through August and September. It is
edible and quite good.</p>


<h3><i>Sparassis crispa. Fr.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span></h3>

<p><i>Crispus</i>, curly. This is a beautiful rosette-like plant, growing quite large at
times, very much branched, whitish, oyster-colored, or pale yellow; branches
intricate, flat and leaf-like, having a spore surface on both sides. The entire plant
forms a large round mass with its leaf-like surface variously curled, folded, and
lobed, with a crest-like margin, and springing from a well-marked root, most of
which is buried in the ground.</p>

<p>No one will have any trouble to recognize it, having once seen its photograph.
I found the plant quite frequently, in the woods about Bowling Green. It is not
simply good, but very good.</p>


<h3><i>Clavaria. Linn.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span></h3>

<p>Clavaria is from <i>clavus</i>, a club. This is by far the largest genus in this
family, and contains very many edible species, some of which are excellent.</p>

<p>The entire genus is fleshy, either branched or simple; gradually thickening
toward the top, resembling a club.</p>

<p>In collecting clavaria special attention should be given to the character of the
apices of the branches, color of the branches, color of spores, the taste of the
plant, and the character of the place of its growth. This genus is readily recognized,
and no one need to hesitate to eat any of the branching forms.</p>


<h3><i>Clavaria flava. Schaeff.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pale-yellow Clavaria. Edible.</span></p>

  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 385.</span>&mdash;Clavaria flava. Natural size.</p>
</div>

<p>Flava is from <i>flavus</i>, yellow. The plant is rather fragile, white and yellow,
two to five inches high, the mass of branches from two to five inches wide, the
trunk thick, much branched. The branches are round, even, smooth, crowded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
nearly parallel, pointing upward, whitish or yellowish, with pale yellow tips of
tooth-like points. When the plant is old, the yellow tips are likely to be faded,
and the whole plant whitish in color. The flesh and the spores are white, and
the taste is agreeable.</p>

<p>I have eaten this species since 1890, and I regard it as very good. It is
found in woods and grassy open places. I have found it as early as June and
as late as October.</p>


<h3><i>Clavaria aurea. Pers.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Golden Clavaria. Edible.</span></p>

<p>This plant grows from three to four inches high. Its trunk is thick, elastic,
and its branches are uniformly a deep golden yellow, often longitudinally
wrinkled. The branches straight, regularly forked and round.</p>

<p>The stem is stout but
thinner than in C. flava.
The spores are yellowish
and elliptical. It is found
in woods during August
and September.</p>

</div>

<p>Botrytes is from a Greek
word meaning a cluster of
grapes. This plant differs
little from C. flava in size
and structure, but it is
easily recognized from the
red tips of its branches. It
is whitish, or yellowish, or
pinkish, with its branches
red-tipped.</p>

<p>The stem is short, thick,
fleshy, whitish, unequal.
The branches are often
somewhat wrinkled, crowded,
repeatedly branched.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
In older specimens the red tips will be somewhat faded. The spores are white
and oblong-elliptical. It is found in woods and open places, during wet weather.
I found this plant occasionally near Salem, from July to October, but it is not
a common plant in Ohio.</p>


<h3><i>Clavaria muscoides. Linn.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Forked Yellow Clavaria. Edible.</span></p>

<p>Muscoides means moss-like. This plant is inclined to be tough, though
graceful in growth; slender-stemmed, two or three time forked; smooth; base
downy, bright yellow. The branchlets are thin, crescent-shape, acute. The
spores are white and nearly round. The plant is usually solitary, not branching
as much as some other species; quite dry, very smooth, except at the base, which
is downy, in color resembling the yolk of an egg. It is frequently found in

thickness; whitish, or yellowish, elastic, the branches numerous, crowded, elongated,
divided at the ends into yellow branchlets, which are thin, straight, obtuse or toothed.</p>

<p>The spores are elongated-oval, rough, buff-colored, 16Ã—8Âµ.</p>

<p>This is an extremely beautiful plant, very tender or brittle. When the plant
is quite young, just coming through the ground, the tips of the branches are often
of a bright red or pink. This bright color soon fades, leaving the entire plant
a light yellow in color.</p>

<p>The plant has a wide distribution, and is found on the ground in the woods,
frequently growing in rows. While the handsomest of the Clavarias, it is not the
best, and only the tender parts of the plant should be used. It is found from
July to October. The specimen in Figure 392 was found in Poke Hollow.</p>


<h3><i>Clavaria cristata. Pers.</i></h3>

  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 393.</span>&mdash;Clavaria cristata.</p>
</div>

<p>Cristata is
from <i>cristatus</i>,
crested. This is
a smaller plant
than the C. flava
or C. botrytes.
It is usually two
to three inches
high, white or
whitish, the
tufts of broad
flattened branches,
sometimes
tinged with a
dull pink or
creamy-yellow.
The branches
are numerous,
widened and
flattened above, deeply cut into several finger-like points, sometimes so numerous
as to give it a crested appearance. This peculiar characteristic distinguishes it
from C. coralloides. When the plant is old the tips usually turn brown.</p>

<p>Sometimes a form will be found in which the crested appearance is wanting,
and in that case the branches terminate in blunt points. The stem is short and
inclined to be spongy.</p>

<p>It is found in the woods, in cool, moist, shady places. While it is tougher
than some of the other species, if cut fine and well cooked it is very good. I have
eaten it for years. It is found from June to October.</p>

branchlets truncate-obtuse at apex and there encircled with a crown of minute
processes. <i>Morgan</i>.</p>

<p>This plant is found on decayed wood. It is repeatedly branched in twos
and forms clusters sometimes several inches in height. It resembles in form C.
pyxidata, but it is quite a distinct species. In some localities it is found quite
frequently. It is plentiful about Chillicothe. Found from July to October.</p>

<p>These plants are unbranched, solitary, about one inch high, elongated, base
somewhat blunt, even when dry, yellow.</p>

<p>Its habitat is very similar to C. cornea but more scattered. C. striata, Fr.,
is very similar to C. cornea, but is distinguished by its being solitary, and striate
or rugose when dry.</p>


<h3><i>Typhula. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Epiphytal. Stem filiform, flaccid; clubs cylindrical, perfectly distinct from
hymenium, sometimes springing from a sclerotium; hymenium thin and waxy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span></p>

<p>This is distinguished from Clavaria and Pistillaria by having its stem distinct
from the hymenium. It is a small plant resembling, in miniature, Typha, hence
its generic name.</p>


<h3><i>Typhula erythropus. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Simple; club cylindrical, slender, smooth, white; stem nearly straight, dark
red, inclining to be black, springing usually from a blackish and somewhat wrinkled
sclerotium. The spores are oblong, 5&ndash;6Ã—2&ndash;2.5Âµ.</p>

<p>This plant has a wide distribution, and is found in damp places upon the
stems of herbaceous plants.</p>


<h3><i>Typhula incarnata. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Simple; club cylindrical, elongated, smooth; whitish, more or less tinged with
pink above; one to two-inches high, base minutely strigose, springing from a
compressed brownish sclerotium. The spores are nearly round, 5Ã—4Âµ.</p>

<p>This is a common and beautiful little plant and easily distinguished both by
its color and the size and form of its spores. If the collector will watch the dead
herbaceous stems in damp places, he will not only find the two just described,
but another, differing in color, size, and form of spores, called T. phacorrhiza, Fr.
It has a brownish color and its spores are quite oblong, 8&ndash;9Ã—4&ndash;5Âµ.</p>


<h3><i>Lachnocladium. Lev.</i></h3>

<p>Lachnocladium is
from two Greek
words meaning a
fleece and a branch.</p>

<p>Pileus coriaceous,
tough, repeatedly
branched; the
branches slender or
filiform, tomentose.
Hymenium amphigenous.
Fungi slender
and much
branched, terrestrial,
but sometimes growing
on wood.</p>

TREMELLINI FR.</h2>


<p>Tremellini is from <i>tremo</i>, to tremble. The whole plant is gelatinous, with
the exception, occasionally, of the nucleus. The sporophores are large, simple or
divided. Spicules elongated into threads. <i>Berk.</i></p>

<p>The following genera are included:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tremella&mdash;Immarginate. Hymenium universal.</li>

<li>Exidia&mdash;Margined. Hymenium superior.</li>

<li>Hirneola&mdash;Cartilaginous, ear-shaped, attached by a point.</li>
</ul>

<h3><i>Tremella. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>This plant is so called because the entire plant is gelatinous, tremulous, and
without a definite margin, and also without nipple-like elevations.</p>


<h3><i>Tremella lutescens. Fr.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Yellowish Tremella. Edible.</span></p>

<p>This is a small gelatinous cluster, tremulous, convoluted, in wavy folds,
pallid, then yellowish, with its lobes crowded and entire. Quite common over the
state. It is found on decaying limbs and stumps from July to winter. It dries
during absence of rain but revives and becomes tremulous during wet weather.
It is called lutescens because of its yellowish color.</p>


<h3><i>Tremella mesenterica. Retz.</i></h3>

<p>Mesenterica is from two Greek words meaning the mesentery. The plant
varies in size and form, sometimes quite flat and thin but generally ascending and
strongly lobed; plicated, and convoluted; gelatinous but firm; lobes short, smooth,
covered with a frost-like bloom by the white spores at maturity. The spores are
broadly elliptical. Common in the woods on decaying sticks and branches.</p>

<p>Albida, whitish. This plant is very common in the woods about Chillicothe,
and everywhere in the state where beech, sugar-maple, and hickory prevail.</p>

<p>It is whitish, becoming dingy-brown when dry; expanded, tough, undulated,
even, more or less gyrose, pruinose. It breaks the bark and spreads in irregular
and scalloped masses; when moist it has a gelatinous consistency, a soft and
clammy touch, yielding like a mass of gelatine. Its spores are oblong, obtuse,
curved, marked with tear-like spots, almost transparent, 12&ndash;14Ã—4&ndash;5Âµ. The specimen
represented in Figure 402 was found near Sandusky and photographed by
Dr. Kellerman.</p>

  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 403.</span>&mdash;Tremella mycetophila.</p>
</div>

<p>Mycetophila is from two Greek words, <i>mycetes</i>, fungi; <i>phila</i>, fond of. The
plant is so called because it is found growing upon other fungi.</p>

<p>Often nearly round, somewhat depressed, circling in folds, sometimes in
quite large masses about the stems of the plant, as will be seen in Figure 403,
tremelloid-fleshy, slightly pruinose, a dirty white or yellowish.</p>

<p>I have found it frequently growing on Collybia drophila, as is the case in
Figure 403. Captain McIlvaine speaks in his book of finding this plant parasitic
on Marasmius oreades in quite a large mass for this plant. I can verify the
statement for I have found it on M. oreades during damp weather in August and
September. It has a pleasant taste.</p>


<h3><i>Tremella fimbriata. Pers.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span></h3>

<p>Fimbriata is from <i>frimbriÃ¦</i>, a fringe.</p>

<p>It is very soft and gelatinous, olivaceous inclining to black, tufted, two to
three inches high, and quite as broad, erect, lobes flaccid, corrugated, cut at the
margin, which gives rise to the name of species; spores are nearly pear shaped.
Found on dead branches, stumps, and on fence-rails in damp weather. Easily
known by its dark color.</p>


<h3><i>Tremellodon. Pers.</i></h3>

<p>Tremellodon means trembling tooth.</p>

<p>These plants are gelatinous, with a cap or pileus; the hymenium covered with
acute gelatinous spines, awl-shaped and equal. The basidia are nearly round
with four rather stout, elongated sterigmata, spores very nearly round.</p>

</div>

<p>Gelatinosum means full of jelly or jelly-like, from <i>gelatina</i>, jelly.</p>

<p>The pileus is dimidiate, gelatinous, tremelloid, one to three inches broad,
rather thick, extended behind into a lateral thick, stem-like base, pileus covered
with a greenish-brown bloom, very minutely granular.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span></p>

<p>The hymenium is watery-gray, covered with hydnum-like teeth, stout, acute,
equal, one to two inches long, whitish, soft, inclined to be glaucous. The spores
are nearly round, 7&ndash;8Âµ.</p>

<p>These plants are found on pine and fir trunks and on sawdust heaps. They
grow in groups and are very variable in form and size but easily determined,
being the only tremelloid fungus with true spines. The plants in Figure 405 were
photographed by Prof. G. D. Smith of Akron, Ohio. They are edible. Found
from September to cold weather.</p>


<h3><i>Exidia. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Gelatinous, marginal, fertile above, barren below. Exidia may be known by
its minute nipple-like elevations.</p>

above, slightly plicated below; soft at first and when moist, becoming film-like
when dry. Found on dead branches of oak.</p>


<h3><i>Hirneola. Fr.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span></h3>

<p>Hirneola is the diminutive of <i>hirnea</i>, a jug. Gelatinous, cup-shaped, horny
when dry. Hymenium wrinkled, becoming cartilaginous when moistened. The
hymenium is in the form of a hard skin which covers the cup-shaped cavities, and
which can be peeled off after soaking in water, the interstices are without papillÃ¦
and the outer surface is velvety.</p>

<p>Auricula-JudÃ¦, the ear of the Jew. The plant is gelatinous; one to four
inches across; thin, concave, wavy, flexible when moist, hard when dry; blackish,
fuzzy, hairy beneath; when covered with white spores it is cinereous. The
hymenium by its corrugations forms depressions such as are found in the human
ear. One will not fail to recognize it after seeing it once. It is not common in
our woods, yet I have found it on several occasions. It is found on almost any
timber but most frequently on the elm and elder. The plant in Figure 406 was
found near Chillicothe. Its distribution is general.</p>


<h3><i>Guepinia. Fr.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 483]<br />[Pg 484]</a></span></h3>

ASCOMYCETES&mdash;SPORE-SAC FUNGI.</h2>


<p>Ascomycetes is from two Greek words: <i>ascos</i>, a sack; <i>mycetes</i>, a fungus or
mushroom. All the fungi which belong to this class develop their spores in small
membranous sacs. These asci are crowded together side by side, and with them are
slender empty asci called paraphyses. The spores are inclosed in these sacs,
usually eight in a sac. They are called sporidia to separate them from the Basidiomycetes.
These sacs arise from a naked or inclosed stratum of fructifying
cells, forming a hymenium or nucleus.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Family&mdash;Helvellaceae.</span></h3>

<p>Hymenium at length more or less exposed, the substance soft. The genera
are distinguished from the earth-tongues by the cup-like forms of the spore body,
but especially by the character of the spore sacs which open by a small lid, instead
of spores. The following are some of the genera:</p>

<ul>
<li>Morchella    Pileus deeply folded and pitted.</li>
<li>Gyromitra    Pileus covered with rounded and variously contorted folds.</li>
<li>Helvella     Pileus drooping, irregularly waved and lobed.</li>
</ul>

<h3><i>Morchella. Dill.</i></h3>

<p>Morchella is from a Greek word meaning a mushroom. This genus is easily
recognized. It may be known by the deeply pitted, and often elongated, naked
head, the depressions being usually regular but sometimes resembling mere furrows
with wrinkled interspaces. The cap or head varies in form from rounded
to ovate or cone shape. They are all marked by deep pits, covering the entire
surface, separated by ridges forming a net-work. The spore-sacs are developed
in both ridges and depressions. All the species when young are of a buff-yellow
tinged with brown. The stems are stout and hollow, white, or whitish in color.</p>

<p>The common name is Morel, and they appear during wet weather early in
the spring.</p>


<h3><i>Morchella esculenta. Pers.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span></h3>

  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 409.</span>&mdash;Morchella esculenta. Two-thirds

</div>

<p>The Common Morel has a cap a
little longer than broad, so that it
is almost oval in outline. Sometimes
it is nearly round but again
it is often slightly narrowed in its
upper half, though not pointed or
cone-like. The pits in its surface
are more nearly round than in the
other species. In this species the
pits are irregularly arranged so
that they do not form rows, as
will be observed in Figure 409.</p>

<p>It grows from two to four
inches high and is known by most
people as the Sponge mushroom.
It grows in woods and wood
borders, especially beside wood
streams. Old apple and peach
orchards are favorite places for
Morels. It makes no difference
if the beginner cannot identify the
species, as they are all equally
good. I have seen collectors have
for sale a bushel basketful, in
which half a dozen species were
represented. They dry very easily
and can be kept for winter use.
It is said to grow in great profusion
over burnt districts. The
German peasants were reputed to
have burned forest tracts to insure
an abundant crop. I find that
more people know the Morels than
any other mushroom. They are
found through April and May,
after warm rains.</p>


<h3><i>Morchella deliciosa. Fr.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span></h3>

<p>This and the preceding species would indicate by their names that they have
been held in high esteem for a long time, as Profs. Persoon and Fries, who
named them, lived more than a hundred years ago. The Delicious Morel is
recognized by the shape of its cap, which is generally cylindrical, sometimes
pointed, and slightly curved. The stem is rather short and, like the stem of all
Morels, is hollow from the top to the bottom.</p>

<p>It is found associated with other species of Morels, in woods and wood
borders, also in old apple and peach orchards. They need to be cooked slowly
and long. Coming early in the spring, they are not likely to be infested with
worms. The flesh is rather fragile and not very watery. They are easily dried.
Found through April and May.</p>

<p>The Conical Morel is very closely related to M. esculenta and M. deliciosa,
from which it differs in having the cap longer than it is wide, and more pointed,
so that it is conical or oblong-conical. The plant, as a general thing, grows to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 488]<br />[Pg 489]</a></span>
be larger than the other species. It is, however, pretty hard to distinguish these
three species. The Conical Morel is quite abundant about Chillicothe. I have
found Morels especially plentiful about the reservoirs in Mercer County, and in
Auglaize, Allen, Harden, Hancock, Wood and Henry Counties. I have known
lovers of Morels to go on camping tours in the woods about the reservoirs for
the purpose of hunting them, and to bring home large quantities of them.</p>

<p>Angusticeps is from two Latin words: <i>angustus</i>, narrow; <i>caput</i>, head. This
species and M. conica are so nearly alike that it is very difficult to identify them
with any degree of satisfaction. In both species the cap is considerably longer
than broad, but in angusticeps the cap is slimmer and more pointed. The pits,
as a general thing are longer than in the other species. They are often found
in orchards but are also frequently found in low woods under black ash trees.
I have found some typical specimens about the reservoirs. The specimens in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>

<p>Semilibera means half
free, and it is so called because
the cap is bell-shaped
and the lower half is free
from the stem. The cap is
rarely more than one inch
long, and is usually much
shorter than the stem, as is
indicated in Figure 414.
The pits on the cap are
longer than broad. The
stem is white or whitish
and somewhat mealy or
scurvy, hollow, and often
swollen at the base. I found
the specimens in Figure 414 about the last of May under elm trees, in James
Dunlap's woods. They are quite plentiful there. I do not detect any difference
in the flavor of these and other species.</p>

  The two-spored Morel. Edible. Showing the cap free from the stem quite to the top.</p>
</div>

<p>Bispora, two-spored, differs from the other species in the fact that the
cap is free from the stem quite to the top. The distinguishing characteristic,
which gives name to the species, can be seen only by the aid of a
strong microscope. In this species there are only two spores in each ascus or
sac, and these are much larger than in the other species, which have eight spores<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
in a sac or ascus.
The ridges, as will
be seen in Figure
415, run from the
top to the bottom.
The stem is much
longer than the cap,
hollow, and sometimes
swollen at the
base. The whole
plant is fragile and
very tender. The
plants in Figure 415
were collected in
Michigan by Prof.
Longyear. Those in
the full page display
were found
near Columbus and
were photographed
by Dr. Kellerman.
It seems to have a
wide range, but is
nowhere very plentiful.</p>

<p>The spores can be readily obtained from morels by taking a mature specimen
and placing it on white paper under a glass for a few hours.</p>

<p>The beginner will find much difficulty in identifying the species of Morels;
but if he is collecting them for food he need not give the matter any thought,
since none need be avoided, and they are so characteristic that no one need be
afraid to gather them.</p>


<h3><i>Morchella crassipes. Pers.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Gigantic Morel. Edible.</span></p>

<p>Crassipes is from <i>crassus</i>, thick; <i>pes</i>, foot.</p>

<p>The cap resembles the cap of M. esculenta in its form and irregular pitting,
but it is quite a little larger. The stem is very stout, much longer than the pileus,
often very much wrinkled and folded. I have found only a few specimens of
this species. Found in April and May.</p>


<h3><i>Verpa. Swartz.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span></h3>

<p>Verpa means a rod. Ascospore
smooth or slightly
wrinkled, free from the
sides of the stem, attached
at the tip of the stem, bell-shaped,
thin; hymenium
covering the entire surface
of the ascospore; asci cylindrical,
8-spored. The spores
are elliptical, hyaline; paraphyses
septate.</p>

<p>The stem is inflated,
stuffed, rather long, tapering
downward.</p>

</div>

<p>Digitaliformis is from
<i>digitus</i>, a finger, and <i>forma</i>,
a form.</p>

<p>The pileus is bell-shaped,
attached to the tip of the
stem, but otherwise free
from it; olive-umber in
color; smooth, thin, closely
pressed to the stem, but always
free; the edge sometimes
inflexed.</p>

<p>The stem is three inches
high, tapering downward,
furnished at the base with
reddish radicels; white, with
a reddish tinge; apparently
smooth, but under the glass quite scaly; loosely stuffed. The asci are large, 8-spored,
the spores being elliptical. The paraphyses are slender and septate.</p>

<p>Figure 417 represents several plants, natural size. The one in the righthand
corner is old, with a ragged pileus; the vertical section shows the pithy
contents of the stem. The plants are found in cool, moist, and shady ravines
from May to August. Edible, but not very good.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>Gyromitra. Fr.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span></h3>

<p>Gyromitra is from <i>gyro</i>, to turn; <i>mitra</i>, a hat or bonnet. This genus is so
called because the plants look like a hood that is much wrinkled or plaited.</p>

<p>Ascophore stipitate; hymenophore subglobose, inflated and more or less
hollow or cavernous, variously gyrose and convolute at the surface, which is
everywhere covered with the hymenium; substance fleshy; asci cylindrical, 8-spored;
spores uniseriate, elongated, hyaline or nearly so, continuous; paraphyses
present. <i>Massee.</i></p>

  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Plate LIV. Figure 418.&mdash;Gyromitra esculenta.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Esculenta means edible. This is the largest spore-sac fungus. The original
name was Helvella esculenta. It is bay-red, round, wrinkled or convoluted,
attached to the stem, irregular, with brain-like convolutions.</p>

<p>The stem is hollow when mature, often very much deformed, whitish, scurvy,
frequently enlarged or swollen at the base, sometimes lacunose, frequently attenuated
upward, at first stuffed; asci cylindrical, apex obtuse, base attenuated,
8-spored; spores obliquely uniseriate, hyaline, smooth, continuous, elliptical, 17&ndash;25Ã—9&ndash;11Âµ;
paraphases numerous.</p>

<p>This plant will be readily recognized from Figure 418, and its bay-red or
chestnut-red cap with its brain-like convolutions. The books speak of its being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 495]<br />[Pg 496]</a></span>
found in pine regions, but I have found it frequently in the woods near Bowling
Green, Sidney, and Chillicothe. Many authors give this plant a bad reputation,
yet I have eaten it often and when it is well prepared it is good. I should advise
caution in its use. It is found in damp sandy woods during May and June. The
plant in Figure 418 was found near Chillicothe.</p>

</div>

<p>Brunnea is from <i>brunneus</i>, brown. A stout, fleshy plant, stipitate, three to
five inches high, bearing a broad, much contorted, brown ascoma. Stem is Â¾
to 1.5 inch thick, more or less enlarged and spongy, solid at the base, hollow
below, rarely slightly fluted, clear white; receptacle two to four inches across
in the widest direction, the two diameters usually more or less unequal, irregularly
lobed and plicate; in places faintly marked into areas by indistinct anastomosing
ridges; closely cohering with the stem in the various parts; color a rich
chocolate-brown or somewhat lighter if much covered with the leaves among
which it grows; whitish underneath; asci 8-spored. Spores oval. This plant is
found quite frequently about Bowling Green. The land is very rich there and
produced both G. esculenta and G. brunnea in greater abundance than I have
found elsewhere in the state. It is quite tender and fragile. The specimen in
Figure 419 was found near Cincinnati and photographed by Mr. C. G. Lloyd.</p>

the Morchellas.</p>

<p>The pileus is inflated, lobed,
cinereous black, lobes deflected,
adnate.</p>

<p>The stem is hollow, white or
dusky, exterior ribbed, forming
intervening cavities.</p>

<p>The asci are cylindrical, and
stemmed. The sporidia are
ovate and hyaline.</p>

<p>The deep longitudinal
grooves in the stem are characteristic
of this species. The
plants from which the halftone

<p>Lactifluorum means milk-flowing. It is parasitic on Lactarius, probably
piperatus, as this species surrounded it. It seems to have the power to change
the color into an orange-red
mass, in many cases entirely
obliterating the gills of the
host-species, as will be seen
in Figure 422.</p>

<p>The asci are long and
slender. The sporidia are in
one row, spindle-shaped,
straight or slightly curved,
rough, hyaline, uniseptic, cuspidate,
pointed at the ends,
30&ndash;38Ã—6&ndash;8Âµ.</p>

<p>This very closely resembles
Hypomyces aurantius,
but the sporidia are larger,
rough and warted and the
felt-like mycelium at the base
is wanting.</p>

<p>It occurs in various colors,
orange, red, white, and purple.
It is not plentiful,
occurring only occasionally.
Capt. McIlvaine says, "When
it is well cooked in small
pieces it is among the best."
It is found from July to
October.</p>

<p>The stem is equal or slightly enlarged above, stuffed, luteous, minutely
scaly.</p>

<p>The spores are oblong, slightly curved, in a double row, 1-1000 to 1-800
inch long. <i>Peck.</i></p>

<p>These are found quite frequently among moss, or where an old log has
rotted down, on the north hillsides about Chillicothe. The plants were first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
described by Dr. Peck as "Geoglossum luteum," but afterwards called by Saccardo
"Leptoglossum luteum." The plants in Figure 423 were found in August
or September, on Ralston's Run, near Chillicothe, and were photographed by
Dr. Kellerman.</p>


<h3><i>Spathularia. Pers.</i></h3>

<p>This is a very interesting genus, and one that will attract the attention of

<h3><i>Peziza. Linn.</i></h3>

<p>Peziza means stalkless mushroom. This is a large genus of discomycetous
fungi in which the hymenium lines the cavity of a fleshy membranous or waxy cup.
They are attached to the ground, decaying wood, or other substances, by the
center, though sometimes they are distinctly stalked. They are often beautifully
colored and are called fairy cups, blood cups, and cup fungi. They are all cup-or
saucer-shaped; externally warted, scurvy or smooth; asci cylindrical, 8-spored.
The genus is large. Prof. Peck reports 150 species. Found early in spring till
early winter.</p>

and were photographed by Dr. Kellerman. No doubt edible, but the writer
has not tried them. This is called Macropodia semitosta.</p>


<h3><i>Peziza aurantia. Fr.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Orange-Ground Peziza. Edible.</span></p>

<p>Aurantia means orange color.</p>

<p>Subsessile, irregular, oblique, externally somewhat pruinose, whitish. The
sporidia are elliptic, rough.</p>

<p>Found on the ground in damp woods. The cups are often quite large and
very irregular. Found in August and September.</p>

</div>

<p>Repanda means bent backward. These plants are found in dark moist woods,
growing on old, wet logs, or in well wooded earth. The cups are clustered or
scattered, subsessile, contracted into a short, stout, stem-like base. When very
small they appear like a tiny white knot on the surface of the log. This grows, so
that soon a hollow sphere with an opening at the top is produced. The plant
now begins to expand and flatten, producing an irregular, flattened disk with
small upturned edges. The margin often becomes split and wavy, sometimes
drooping and revolute; disk pale or dark brown, more or less wrinkled toward
the center; externally the cup is a scurvy-white. The asci are 8-spored, quite
large. The paraphyses are few, short, separate, clavate, and brownish at the
tips. The spores
are elliptical, thin-walled,
hyaline,
non-nucleate, 14Ã—9Âµ.</p>

<p>Found from May
to October. Edible.</p>

cap. The spores are smooth, transparent, continuous, elliptical, ends obtuse.</p>

<p>They are found on dung-hills, hot-beds or wherever the ground has been
strongly fertilized and contains the necessary moisture. This is an interesting
plant and often found in large numbers. Vesicolosa means full of bladders, as
the picture will suggest.</p>

<p>Tuberosa, furnished with a tuber or sclerotium. The cup is thin, infundibuliform,
bright brown, turning pale.</p>

<p>The stem is elongated, springing from an irregular black tuber, called
sclerotium. The stems run deep into the earth and are attached to a sclerotium,
which will be seen in the halftone. Many fungus plants have learned to store
up fungus starch for the new plant.</p>

<p>The sporidia are oblong-ellipsoid, simple. It is called by some authors
Sclerotinia tuberosa. It grows on the ground in the spring and may be known
by its bright brown color and its stem running deep into the earth and attached
to a tuber.</p>


<h3><i>Peziza hemispherica. Wigg.</i></h3>

<p>Sessile, hemispherical, waxy, externally brownish, clothed with dense,

<p>Urnula means burned; craterium means a small crater; hence the translation
is a burned-out crater, which will appear to the student as a very appropriate
name. It is a very common and conspicuous Ascomycetous, or cup fungus,
growing in clusters on rotten sticks that lie in moist places. When the plants
first appear they are small, black stems with scarcely any evidence of a cup. In a
short time the end of the stem shows evidence of enlargement, showing lines
of separation on the top. It soon opens and we have the cup as you see it in
Figure 438. The hymenium, or spore bearing surface, is the interior wall of the
cup. The cup is lined inside with a palisade of long cylindrical sacs, each containing
eight spores with a small amount of liquid. These sacs are at right
angles to the inner surface, and are provided with lids similar to that of a
coffee-pot; at maturity the lid is forced open and the spores are shot out of
these sacs, and, by jarring the fungus when it is ready to make the discharge, they
can be seen as a little cloud an inch or two above the cup. Place a small slip of
glass over the cup and you will see spores in groups of eight in very small drops
of liquid on the glass. This species appears in April and May, and is certainly
a very interesting plant. It is called by some Peziza craterium, Schw.</p>

NIDULARIACEAE&mdash;BIRD'S NEST FUNGI.</h2>


<p>Spores produced on sporophores, compacted into one or more globose or
disciform bodies, contained within a distinct peridium. <i>Berkeley.</i></p>

<p>There are four genera included in this order.</p>


<ul>
<li>Cyathus&mdash;Peridium cup-shaped, composed of three different membranes.</li>
<li>Crucibulum&mdash;Peridium of a uniform spongy membrane.</li>
<li>Nidularia&mdash;Peridium globose, sporangia enveloped in mucus.</li>
<li>SphÃ¦robolus&mdash;Peridium double, sporangia ejected singly.</li>
</ul>

<h3><i>Cyathus. Pers.</i></h3>

<p>Cyathus is from a Greek word meaning a cup.</p>

<p>The peridium is composed of three membranes very closely related, closed at
first by a white membrane, but finally bursting at the top. Sporangia plane,
umbilicate, attached to the wall by an elastic cord.</p>


<h3><i>Cyathus striatus. Hoffm.</i></h3>

<p>The sporangia are somewhat trigonous, whitish, broadly umbilicate; covering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>
of the cup thin, evanescent, somewhat thicker underneath, and cottony, often
covered with down-like meal.</p>

<p>The spores are thick and oblong.</p>

<p>This is a very interesting little plant. It is quite widely distributed. I have
had it from several states, including New England. It is easily identified by the
striations, or lines, on the inside of the cup, being the only species thus marked
by internal striÃ¦. The peridioles of the species fill only the lower part of the
cup, below the striations.</p>

finally becoming smooth, internally lead-colored.</p>

<p>The sporangia are blackish, frequently somewhat pale, even; covering rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>
thick, sprinkled with a grayish meal. Spores elliptical, colorless, 12&ndash;14Ã—10Âµ.
I have frequently seen the ground in gardens and stubble-fields covered with
these beautiful little plants. The quite firm, thick, and flaring cup will easily
distinguish the species. The eggs or peridioles are black and quite large, appearing
white because covered with a thin white membrane. Found in late summer and
fall. The plants in Figure 442 were photographed by Prof. G. D. Smith.</p>


<h3><i>Cyathus stercoreus.</i></h3>

</div>

<p>Stercoreus is from <i>stercus</i>, dung. This species, as the name suggests, is
found on manure or manured grounds. Mr. Lloyd gives the following description:
"The cups are even inside, and with shaggy hairs outside. When old they become
smoother, and are sometimes mistaken for Cyathus vernicosus. However
when once learned, the plants can be readily distinguished by the cups. Cyathus
stercoreus varies considerably, however, as to shape and size of cups, according to
habitat. If growing on a cake of manure, they are shorter and more cylindrical;
if in loose manured ground, especially in grass, they are more slender and
inclined to a stalk at the base." The peridioles or eggs are blacker than other
species. They are found in late summer and fall.</p>


<h3><i>Crucibulum. Tul.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span></h3>

<p>The peridium consists of a uniform, spongy, fibrous felt, closed by a flat
scale-like covering of the same color.</p>

<p>The sporangia are plane, attached by a cord, springing from a small nipple-like
tubercle.</p>

<p>This genus is distinguished from Cyathus, its nearest ally, by the peridial
wall, consisting of two layers only.</p>


<h3><i>Crucibulum vulgare. Tul.</i></h3>

<p>The peridium is tan-colored, thick externally nearly even, internally quite
even, smooth, shining; mouths of young plants are covered with a thin yellowish
membrane called the epiphragm. When old the cups bleach out and lose their
yellow color. The peridioles or eggs are white, that is they are covered with a
white membrane. Their yellowish color and white eggs will readily distinguish
this species.</p>

<p>They are found on decayed weeds, sticks, and pieces of wood. The specimens
in the halftone grew on an old mat and were photographed by Mr. C. G. Lloyd.</p>


<h3><i>Nidularia. Tul.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span></h3>

<p>The peridium is uniform, consisting of a single membrane; globose, at first
closed, finally ruptured or opening with a circular mouth.</p>

<p>The sporangia are quite small and numerous, not attached by a funiculus to
the peridium, enveloped in mucus.</p>

<p>Pisiformis is from two Latin words meaning <i>pea</i> and <i>form</i>.</p>

<p>The plant is gregarious, nearly round, sessile, rootless, hairy, brown or

<p>The sporangia are subrotund or discoidal in form, dark brown, smooth, shining.</p>

<p>The spores are colorless, round or elliptical or pear-shaped, produced on
sterigmata, 7&ndash;8Ã—8&ndash;9Âµ. Sometimes found on the ground and on leaves, but their
favorite home is an old log. Found from July to September.</p>

SUB-CLASS BASIDIOMYCETES.<br />

GROUP GASTROMYCETES.</h2>


<p>Gastromycetes is from two Greek words: <i>gaster</i>, stomach; <i>mycetes</i>, fungus.
We have already seen that, in the group, Hymenomycetes, the spore-bearing
surface is exposed as in the common mushroom or in the pore-bearing varieties,
but in the Gastromycetes the hymenium is inclosed in the rind or peridium. The
word peridium comes from <i>peridio</i> (I wrap around); because the peridium entirely
envelops the spore-bearing portion, which, in due time, sheds the inclosed spores
that have been formed inside the basidia and spicules, as will be seen in Figure 2.
The cavity within the peridium consists of two parts: the threaded part, called
the capillitium, which can be seen in any dried puffball, and a cellular part, called
the gleba, which is the spore-bearing tissue, composed of minute chambers lined
with the hymenium. The peridium breaks in various ways to permit the spores
to escape. When children pinch a puffball to "see the smoke," as they say, issue
from it, little do they know that they are doing just what the puffball would have
them do, in order that its seeds may be scattered to the winds.</p>

<p>In case of the Phalloides, the hymenium deliquesces, instead of drying up.</p>

<p>Berkeley, in his "Outlines," gives the following characterization of this family:
"Hymenium more or less permanently concealed, consisting in most cases of
closely packed cells, of which the fertile ones bear naked spores in distinct spicules,
exposed only by the rupture or decay of the investing coat or peridium."</p>

<p>The following families will be treated here:</p>

<ol class="RU">
<li>PhalloideÃ¦&mdash;Terrestrial. Hymenium deliquescent.</li>

<li>LycoperdaceÃ¦&mdash;Cellular at first. Hymenium drying up in a mass of
threads and spores.</li>

<li>SclerodermaceÃ¦&mdash;Peridium inclosing sporangia.</li></ol>

</div>

<p>This plant is extremely
abundant about Chillicothe.
I have seen hundreds
of fully developed
plants on a few square
yards of old sawdust;
and one might easily
think that all the bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>
smells in the world had been turned loose at that place. The eggs in
the sawdust can be gathered by the bushel. In Figure 449 is represented a cluster,
of these eggs. The section of an egg in the center of the cluster shows the
outline of the volva, the pileus, and the embryo stem. Inside of the volva, in the
middle, is the short undeveloped stem; covering the upper part and sides of the
stem is the pileus; the fruit-bearing part, which is divided into small chambers,
lies on the outside of the pileus. The spores are borne on club-shaped basidia as
shown in Figure 448, within the chamber of the fruit-bearing part, and when the
spores mature, the stem begins to elongate and force the gleba and pileus through
the volva, leaving it at the base of the stem, as will be seen in Figure 448. The large
egg on the left in the background of Figure 449 is nearly ready to break the volva.
I brought in a large egg one evening and placed it on the mantle. Later in the
evening, the room being warm, while we were reading my wife noticed this egg
beginning to move and it developed in a few minutes to the shape you see in Figure
447. The development was so rapid that the motion was very perceptible. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>
pileus is conical in shape, and after the disappearance of the gleba the surface
of the pileus is merely granular. The plants are four to six inches high. The
stem is hollow and tapers from the middle to each end. This plant is also known
as Dictyophora Ravenelii, Burt.</p>

<p>The receptacle is borne on a stalk, hollow, attenuated toward the base, divided
above into arms, which do not join at their apices, and which bear the spore mass
in their inner surfaces and sides, inclosing the spore mass when young, but later
diverging.</p>

<p>The stem of the phalloid is white, hollow, attenuated downward; the arms are
narrow, lance-shaped, with pale flesh-colored backs, traversed their entire length
by a shallow furrow.</p>

<p>The egg in the center is about ready to break the volva and develop to a full
grown plant. The plants in Figure 450 were found near Akron, Ohio, and
photographed by G. D. Smith.</p>


<h3><i>Mutinus. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>The gleba is borne directly on the upper portion of the stem, which is hollow
and composed of a single layer of tissue; and the plant has no separate pileus,
by which characteristic the genus differs from Phallus.</p>

one-sixth the total length of the stem.</p>

<p>The stem is elongated, spindle-shaped, hollow,
cylindrical, cellular, white, sometimes rosy. The
spores are elliptical, involved in a green mucus,
6Ã—4Âµ. The plant comes from an egg, which is
about the size of a quail's egg. You can find
them in the ground if you will mark the place
where you have seen them growing. They are
found in gardens and in old woods and thickets.
I have found this species in several localities
about Chillicothe, but always in damp thickets.
Mr. Lloyd thought this more nearly resembled
the European species than any he had seen in
this country. Found in July, August, and
September.</p>

<p>The odor of this plant is not as strong as in some of the Phalloids. The
eggs of Phallus and Mutinus are said to be very good when fried properly,
but my recollection of the odor of the plant has been too vivid for me to try
them. It is usually found in mixed woods, but sometimes in richly cultivated
fields. I have found them frequently about Chillicothe six to seven inches
high. In Figure 452 on the right is shown an egg and above it is a section
of an egg containing the embryonic plant. This plant is called by Prof.
Morgan Mutinus bovinus. After seeing this picture the collector will not fail
to recognize it. It is one of the curious growths in nature. Found in July

LYCOPERDACEAE&mdash;PUFF-BALLS.</h2>


<p>This family includes all fungi which have their spores in closed chambers
until maturity. The chambers are called the gleba and this is surrounded by the
peridium or rind, which in different puffballs exhibits various characteristic ways
of opening to let the spores escape. The peridium is composed of two distinct
layers, one called the cortex, the other the peridium proper. The plant is generally
sessile, sometimes more or less stemmed, at maturity filled with a dusty
mass of spores and thread.</p>

<p>It affords many of our most delicious fungus food products. The following
genera are considered here:</p>


<ol class="RU">
<li>Calvatia&mdash;The large puffball.</li>
<li>Lycoperdon&mdash;The small puffball.</li>
<li>Bovista&mdash;The tumbling puffball.</li>
<li>Geaster&mdash;Earth Star.</li>
<li>Scleroderma&mdash;The hard puffball.</li>
</ol>


<h3><i>Calvatia. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>This genus represents the largest sized puffballs. They have a thick cord-like
mycelium rooting from the base. The peridium is very large, breaking away
in fragments when ripe and exposing the gleba. The cortex is thin, adherent,
often soft and smooth like kid leather, sometimes covered with minute squamules;
the inner peridium is thin and fragile, at maturity cracking into areas. The
capillitium is a net-work of fine threads through the tissues of spore-bearing
portion; tissue, snow white at first, turning greenish-yellow, then brown; the
mass of spores and the dense net-work of threads (capillitium) attached to the
peridium and to the subgleba or sterile base which is cellulose; limited and concave
above. Spores small, round, usually sessile.</p>


<h3><i>Calvatia gigantea. Batsch.</i></h3>

  </a>
  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Plate LVII. Figure 454.&mdash;Calvatia gigantea.</span></p>
</div>

<p>This species grows to an immense size (often twenty inches in diameter); round
or obovoid, with a thick mycelial cord rooting it to the ground, sessile, cortex
white and glossy, sometimes slightly roughened by minute floccose warts, becoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 532]<br />[Pg 533]</a></span>
yellowish or brown. The inner peridium is thin and fragile, after maturity breaking
up into fragments, apparently without any subgleba; capillitium and spores
yellowish-green to dingy-olive. The spores are round, sometimes minutely warted.</p>

<p>Not common about Chillicothe, but in the northwestern part of the state they
are very plentiful in their season, and very large. Standing in Mr. Joseph's wood-pasture,
east of Bowling Green, I have counted fifteen giant puffballs whose
diameters would average ten inches, and whose cortex was as white and glossy
as a new kid glove. A friend of mine, living in Bowling Green, and driving home
from Deshler, saw in a wood-pasture twenty-five of these giant puffballs. Being
impressed with the sight and having some grain sacks in his wagon he filled them
and brought them home. He at once telephoned for me to come to his house, as
the mountain was too big to take to Mohammed. He was surprised to learn that
he had found that proverbial calf which is all sweet-breads. That evening we
supplied twenty-five families with slices of these puffballs.</p>

<p>They can be kept for two or three days on ice. The photograph, taken by
Prof. Shaffner of Ohio State University, will show how they look growing in the
grass. They seem to delight to nestle in the tall bluegrass. This species has been
classed heretofore as Lycoperdon giganteum. Found from August to October.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span></p>

<p>The peridium is three to six inches in diameter; globose or depressed globose;
smooth or minutely floccose or scaly; whitish, cinereous-brown or pinkish-brown,
often cracking into areas in the upper part; commonly with a short, thick, stemless
base; capillitium and spores purple-brown, these and the upper part of the peridium
falling away and disappearing when old, leaving a cup-shaped base with a ragged
margin. Spores globose, rough, purple-brown, 5&ndash;6.5 broad. <i>Peck</i>, 48th Rep. N. Y.
State Bot.</p>

<p>It is very common all over the state. I have seen pastures in Shelby and
Defiance counties dotted all over with this species. When the inside is white, they
are very good and meaty. No puffball is poisonous, so far as is known, but if the
inside has turned yellowish at all it is apt to be quite bitter. It will often be seen
in pastures and open woods in the form of a cup, the upper portion having
broken away and the wind having scooped out the purple spore-mass, leaving
only the cup-shaped base. The specimens in Figure 457 are just beginning to
crack open and to show purplish stains. They represent less than one-fourth of
the natural size. They look very much like the smaller sized C. gigantea, but the
purple spores and the subgleba at once distinguish the species. This species,
found from July to October, is sometimes classed as Lycoperdon cyathiforme.

<p>CÃ¦lata, carved. Peridium large, obovoid or top-shaped, depressed above,
with a stout thick base and a cord-like root. Cortex a thickish floccose layer, with
coarse warts or
spines above, whitish
then ochraceous or
finally brown, at
length breaking up
into areola which
are more or less persistent;
inner peridium
thick but fragile,
thinner about the
apex, where it finally
ruptures, forming a
large, irregular, torn
opening. Subgleba
occupying nearly
half the peridium,
cup-shaped above
and for a long time
persistent; the mass
of spores and capillitium
compact, farinaceous
greenish-yellow
or olivaceous,
becoming pale to
dark-brown; the
threads are very
much branched, the
primary branches
two or three times
as thick as the
spores, very brittle, soon breaking up into fragments. Spores globose, even, 4&ndash;4.5
in diameter, sessile or sometimes with a short or minute pedicel. Peridium is
three to five inches in diameter. <i>Morgan.</i></p>

<p>This species is much like the preceding but can be easily distinguished by the
larger size and the yellowish-olive color of the mature spore-mass. The sterile base
is often the larger part of the fungus and, as will be seen in Figure 459, it is anchored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 538]<br />[Pg 539]</a></span>
by a heavy root-like growth. It is found growing on the ground in fields and
thin woods. When white through and through, sliced, rolled in egg and cracker
crumbs, and nicely fried, you are glad you know a puffball. Found from August
to October.</p>

<p>Craniiformis is from <i>Cranion</i>, a skull; <i>forma</i>, a form.</p>

<p>The peridium is very large, obovoid or top-shaped, depressed above, the base
thick and stout, with a cord-like root. The cortex is a smooth continuous layer,
very thin and fragile, easily peeling off, pallid or grayish, sometimes with a reddish
tinge, often becoming folded in areas; the inner peridium is thin, ochraceous to
bright-brown, extremely fragile, the upper part, after maturity, breaking into
fragments and falling away.</p>

<p>The subgleba occupies about one-half of the peridium, is cup-shaped above
and for a long time persistent; the mass of spores and capillitium is greenish-yellow,
then ochraceous or dirty olivaceous; the threads are very long, about as
thick as the spores, branched. The spores are globose, even, 3&ndash;3.5Âµ in diameter,
with minute pedicels. <i>Morgan.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span></p>

<p>It is difficult to distinguish
this from C. lilacina when fresh,
but when ripe the color will tell
the species. Figure 460 shows
the plant as it appears on the
ground, and figure 461 shows
the subgleba or sterile base,
which is frequently found on
the ground after weathering
the winter. This plant is very
common on the hillsides under
small oak shrubbery. I have
gathered a basketful within a
few feet. They grow very large,
often five to six inches in diameter,
seeming to delight in
rather poor soil. When the
spore-mass is white this is an
excellent fungus, but exceedingly
bitter after it has turned
yellow. Found during October
and November.</p>

</div>

<p>Elata means tall; so called
from its long stem.</p>

<p>The peridium is round, often
slightly depressed above, plicate
below, where it is abruptly contracted
into a long stem-like
base. The base is slender,
round, and frequently pitted;
mycelium rather plentiful,
fibrous and thread-like. When
in good condition it is a rich
cream color. The cortex consists
of a coat of minute per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span>sistent
granules or spinules. The inner peridium is white or cream-colored,
becoming brown or olivaceous, quite thin and fragile, the upper part at maturity
breaking up and falling away. The subgleba occupies the stem. The mass of
spores and capillitium is usually brown or greenish-brown. The threads are very
long, branched, branches slender. Spores round, even, sometimes slightly warted,
4&ndash;5Âµ, with a slight pedicel.</p>

<p>The plant grows on low mossy grounds among bushes, especially where it is
inclined to be swampy. The plant in Figure 462 was found in a sphagnum swamp
near Akron and was photographed by Prof. G. D. Smith. I am inclined to think
it the same as Calvatia saccata, Fr.</p>


<h3><i>Lycoperdon. Tourn.</i></h3>

<p>Mycelium fibrous, rooting from the base. Peridium small, globose, obovoid
or turbinate, with a more or less thickened base; cortex a subpersistent coat of soft
spines, scales, warts or granules; inner peridium thin, membranaceous, becoming
papyraceous, dehiscent by a regular apical mouth. <i>Morgan.</i></p>

<p>This genus includes puffballs with apical openings and is divided into
two series, a purple-spored and an olive-spored series. The microscope shows
that the gleba is composed of a great number of spores mixed with simple or
branched threads. There are two sets of threads; one set arises from the peridial
wall and the other from the subgleba or columella.</p>

</div>

<p>Pulcherrimum, most beautiful. The peridium is obovoid, with a short base,
the mycelium forming a cord like a root. The cortex is covered with long white
spines, converging at the apex, as will be seen in Figure 463. The spines soon fall
from the upper part of the peridium, leaving the inner peridium with a smooth
purplish-brown surface, often slightly scarred by the base of the spine. The subgleba
occupies at least a third of the peridium. The spores and the capillitium are
at first olivaceous, then brownish-purple, the spores rough and minutely warted.
The plant is one to two inches in diameter. It is found in low, rich ground, in
fields and wood margins. Only young and fresh plants are good.</p>

<p>The lower plant in Figure 463 shows where the spines have begun to fall,
also the strong mycelial cord referred to in the description. I am indebted to Mr.
Lloyd for the photograph. Found in September and October.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>Lycoperdon umbrinum. Pers.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Smooth Puffball. Edible.</span></p>

<p>Umbrinum, dingy umber. Peridium obovate, nearly sub-turbinate, with a
soft, delicate, velvety bark; yellowish; inner peridium smooth and glossy, opening
by a small aperture. The spores and capillitium, olivaceous, then purplish-brown.
The capillitium with a central columella. A very attractive little plant, not frequently
found. This plant is also called L. glabellum. In woods, September
and October.</p>

  Natural size. Entirely white when young. From the young to the matured dehiscing plant.</p>
</div>

<p>The peridium is turbinate, depressed above; the base short and obconic, or
more elongated and tapering, or subcylindric, arising from a fibrous mycelium.
The cortex consists of long, thick, erect spines or warts of irregular shape, with
intervening smaller ones, whitish or gray in color, sometimes with a tinge of red
or brown; the larger spines first fall away, leaving pale spots on the surface, and
giving it a reticulate appearance. The subgleba is variable in amount, usually
more than half the peridium; mass of spores and capillitium greenish-yellow,
then pale-brown; threads simple or scarcely branched, about as thick as the
spores. Spores globose, even, or very minutely warted. <i>Morgan.</i></p>

<p>The species is readily recognized by the large erect spines which, because
of their peculiar form and color, have given the notion of gems, whence the name
of the species. These and the reticulations can be seen in Figure 465 by the aid
of a glass. They are frequently found about Chillicothe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span></p>

  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 466.</span>&mdash;Lycoperdon subincarnatum.</p>
</div>

<p>Subincarnatum means pale flesh-color. The peridium is globe-shaped, sessile,
without a stem-like base. Not large, rarely over one inch in diameter. The
subgleba is present but small. The outer peridium is pinkish-brown, with minute
short, stout spinules, which fall away at maturity, leaving the inner ash-colored
peridium neatly pitted by the falling off of the spinules of the outer coat, the
pits not being surrounded by dotted lines. The capillitium and spores are first
greenish-yellow, then brownish-olive. The threads are long, simple, and transparent.
The columella is present and the spores are round and minutely warted.</p>

<p>They are often found in abundance on decayed logs, old stumps, and on the
ground about stumps where the ground is especially full of decayed wood. They
are found from August to October.</p>

  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 467.</span>&mdash;Lycoperdon cruciatum.</p>
</div>

<p>Peridium broadly ovate, often much depressed, plicate underneath, with a
cord-like root; cortex a dense white coat of convergent spines, which at maturity
peel off in flakes, as can be seen in the photograph, revealing a thin furfuraceous
layer of minute yellowish scales covering the inner peridium. The subgleba broad,
occupying about one-third of the cavity. The spores and capillitium are dark-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</a></span>brown.
This species is very hard to distinguish from Wrightii. It was once called
<i>separans</i> because of the fact that the outer coat separates, or peels off, so readily
from the inner peridium. Found in open woods, or along paths in open woods
or pastures.</p>

<p>From July to October.</p>

  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 468.</span>&mdash;Lycoperdon Wrightii. Natural size.</p>
</div>

<p>The specific name is in honor of Charles Wright. The peridium is globe-like,
sessile, white, minutely spinulose, often converging at the apex; when denuded,
smooth or minutely velvety.</p>

<p>The spores and capillitium greenish-yellow, then brown-olive; the columella
present, but very small. Spores small, smooth, 3&ndash;4Âµ.</p>

<p>The plants are very small, scarcely more than two cm. in diameter. They
are generally cÃ¦spitose in short grass, along paths, and in sandy places.</p>

<p>I have frequently seen the ground white with them on Cemetery Hill where
the specimens in Figure 468 were found. They were photographed by Dr.
Kellerman. Found from July to the last of October.</p>


<h3><i>Lycoperdon pyriforme. Schaeff.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span></h3>

</div>

<p>Pyriforme means pear-shaped. The peridium is ovate or pear-shaped, with a
profusion of mycelial threads, as will be seen in Figure 470.</p>

<p>The cortex is
covered with a thin
coat of minute
brownish scales or
granules, which are
quite persistent.
These can be seen
in the photograph
by the aid of a
glass. They are
sessile or have a
short stem-like
base; the subgleba
is small and compact;
the capillitium
and spores
are first white, then
greenish-yellow,
then dingy olivaceous;
the inner coat
is smooth, papery,
whitish-gray or
brownish, opening
by an apical
mouth; the spores
are round, even,
greenish-yellow to
brownish-olive.</p>

<p>They grow in
dense clusters, as
will be seen in Figure
470. An entire log and stump, about four feet high, and the roots around it,
were covered, as shown in Plate LXII. I gathered about three pecks, at this one
place, to divide with my friends. It is one of the most common puffballs, and you
may usually be sure of getting some, if you go into the woods where there are
decayed logs and stumps. A friend of mine, who goes hunting with me occasionally,
eats them as one would eat cherries.</p>

<p>Found from July to November.</p>

<h3><i>Lycoperdon pusillum. Pr.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Small Lycoperdon. Edible.</span></p>

<p>Pusillum means small.</p>

<p>Peridium is one-fourth to one inch broad, globose, scattered or cespitose,
sessile, radicating, with but little cellular tissue at the base, white, or whitish,
brownish when old, rimose-squamulose or slightly roughened with minute floccose
or furfuraceous persistent warts; capillitium and spores greenish-yellow, then
dingy olivaceous. Spores smooth 4Âµ in diameter. <i>Peck.</i></p>

<p>These are found from June to cool weather in the fall, in pastures where the
grass is eaten short. When mature they dehisce by a small opening, and when
broken open will disclose the olive or greenish-yellow capillitium. The spores are
of the same color, smooth and round.</p>


<h3><i>Lycoperdon acuminatum. Bosc.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Pointed Lycoperdon. Edible.</span></p>

<p>Acuminatum means pointed.</p>

<p>The peridium is small, round, then egg-shaped; with a plentiful mass of
mycelium in the moss in which the plants seem to delight. The plant is white
and the outer rind is soft and delicate. There is no subgleba; the spores and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span>
capillitium are pale-greenish-yellow, then a dirty gray. The threads are simple,
transparent, much thicker than the spores. The spores are round, smooth, 3Âµ in
diameter.</p>

<p>I have found the plants frequently about Chillicothe on damp, moss-covered
logs and sometimes at the base of beech trees, when covered with moss. They are
very small, not exceeding one-half inch in diameter. The small ovoid form, with
the white, soft, delicate cortex, will serve to distinguish the species. Found from
September to October.</p>


<h3><i>Bovista. Dill.</i></h3>

<p>The genus Bovista differs from Lycoperdon in several ways. When the
Bovista ripens it breaks from its moorings and is blown about by the wind. It
opens by an apical mouth, as does the genus Lycoperdon, but the species of
Bovista have no sterile base. They are puffballs of small size. The outer coat
is thin and fragile and at maturity peels off, leaving an inner coat firm, papery,
and elastic, just such a coat as is suitable for the dispersion of its spores. Leaving
its moorings at maturity, it is blown about the fields and woods, and with every
tumble it makes it scatters some of its spores. It may take years to accomplish
this perfectly. The species of the Lycoperdon do not leave their moorings naturally;
their spores are dispersed through an apical mouth by a collapse of the walls
of the peridium, after the fashion of a bellows, by which spores are driven out to
the pleasure of the wind. In Bovista the threads are free or separate from the
peridium, but in Lycoperdon they arise from the peridium and also from the
columella.</p>

</div>

<p>Pila means a round ball. The peridium is globe-like, sessile, with a stout
mycelium, a cortex thin, white at first, then brown, forming a smooth continuous
coat, breaking up at maturity and rapidly disappearing.</p>

<p>The inner peridium is tough, parchment-like, elastic, smooth, persistent,
purplish-brown, fading to gray. The dispersion of spores takes place through
an apical mouth. The capillitium is firm, compact, persistent, at first clay-colored,
then purple-brown; threads small-branched, the ends being rigid, straight, pointed.
There is something so noticeable about this little tumbler that you will know it
when you see it, and if you often ramble over the fields you will soon meet it.
However, I have as yet seen only the matured specimens.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>Bovista plumbea. Pers.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</a></span></h3>

  </a>
  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 472.</span>&mdash;Bovista plumbea. Natural size. White when young.</p>
</div>

<p>The plant is small, never growing to more than an inch and a fourth in diameter.
The peridium is depressed globose, with a fibrous mycelium. The outer
peridium is rather thick and when the plant is nearing maturity it breaks up readily
unless handled very carefully; at maturity it scales off, except a small portion
about the base. The outer peridium is white and comparatively smooth, the
inner is thin, tough, smooth, lead-colored, dehiscent at the apex by a round or
oblong mouth. Mass of spores and capillitium not solid or hard; yellowish-brown,
or olivaceous, then purplish-brown; the threads three to five times branched, the
ends of the branches slender and tapering to a point. The spores are oval and
smooth, with long transparent pedicels.</p>

<p>This species grows on the ground in old pastures, being quite plentiful after
warm rains, from the first of May till fall. It is one of the best of the puffballs,
but should be eaten before the inner peridium begins to assume the tough form.</p>


<h3><i>Bovistella. Morgan.</i></h3>

<p>Bovistella, a diminutive of Bovista, though the plants are usually larger than
the Bovistas.</p>

<p>The mycelium is cord-like; peridium nearly round, cortex a dense floccose
coat; inner peridium thin, strong, elastic, opening by an apical mouth; subgleba
present, cup-shaped; threads free and separate, branched; spores white. The
genus Bovistella has the internal character of Bovista, and the habits of Lycoperdon.</p>


<h3><i>Bovistella Ohiensis. Morgan.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</a></span></h3>

  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 473.</span>&mdash;Bovistella Ohiensis. Natural size.</p>
</div>

<p>Peridium globe-like or broadly obovoid, sometimes much depressed, with
small plications or wrinkles underneath, and a thick cord-like base or root, as
will be seen in Figure 473. The outer coat is dense, floccose, or with soft warts
or spines, white or grayish, drying to a buff color, and in time falling away; the
inner coat is smooth, shining, with a pale brown or yellowish surface. The subgleba
is large, occupying half of the peridium, extending up on the walls of the
peridium, making it cup-shaped, and quite persistent. The spores and capillitium
are rather loose, friable, clay-color to pale-brown. The threads, originating
within the spore mass, and having no connection with the inner coat, are free,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 554]<br />[Pg 555]</a></span>
short, three to five times branching; branches tapering to the end. The spores are
round to oval, with long translucent pedicels.</p>

<p>This can be readily distinguished from the species of Bovista because it has
a sterile base; and from Lycoperdon because its threads are separate and free,
while those of the Lycoperdon are attached both to the tissues of the inner peridium
and to the columella or sterile base.</p>

<p>They are found growing on the ground in old pastures, or in open woods.</p>


<h3><i>Scleroderma. Pers.</i></h3>

<p>Scleroderma is
from two Greek
words: <i>scleros</i>,
hard; <i>derma</i>, skin.</p>

<p>The peridium is
firm, single, generally
thick, usually
bursting irregularly,
and exposing
the gleba, which is
of uniform texture
and consistency.
There is no capillitium,
but yellow
flocci are found interspersed
with the
spores. The spores
are globose, rough,
usually mixed with
the hyphÃ¦ tissue.</p>

<p>Aurantium means
colored like an orange.
This is usually
called S. vulgare.
The peridium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span>
is rough, warty, depressed, globose, corky and hard, yellowish, opening by irregular
fissures to scatter the spores; inner mass bluish-black, spores dingy. The plant
remains solid until it is quite old. It is sessile, with a rooting base which is never
sterile.</p>

<p>I have followed Mr. Lloyd's classification in separating the species, calling
the rough-surfaced one S. aurantium, and the smooth-surfaced S. cepa.</p>

<p>In labeling it edible I wish only to indicate that it is not poisonous, as it is
generally thought to be; however, it cannot be claimed as a very good article of
food.</p>

<p>It has a wide distribution over the states. The plants in Figure 475 were
found on Cemetery Hill, Chillicothe, and photographed by Dr. Kellerman.
Found from August to November.</p>

  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 476.</span>&mdash;Scleroderma tenerum.</p>

<p>This species is often regarded
as a small form of S. verrucosum,
but it always seemed strange to
me that this rather smooth plant
should be called "verrucosum"
when its frequently near neighbor,
S. aurantium, is very verrucose.</p>

<p>S. tenerum is a very widely
distributed species in the United
States, somewhat constant as to
form and quite frequent in occurrence.
Mr. Lloyd, in his Mycological
Notes, gives a very clear
photograph of a plant that is
quite local in this country and
which he thinks should be called
S. verrucosum of Europe.</p>

<p>The plant differs very widely
from the one we find so commonly
which by many authors
has been called S. verrucosum.
Some have even called it Scleroderma
bovista.</p>

<p>The plant is nearly sessile,
somewhat irregular, peridium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 557]<br />[Pg 558]</a></span>
thin, soft, yellowish, densely marked with small scales, dehiscence irregular,
flocci yellow and spores dingy olive.</p>

<p>The species may be known by the thin and comparatively smooth peridium
and yellow flocci. It is quite common in the United States, while the typical
plant, S. verrucosum, is confined to a few localities along the Atlantic coast.</p>


<h3><i>Scleroderma Cepa. Pers.</i></h3>

<p>Cepa meaning an onion; having very much the appearance of an onion.</p>

<p>The peridium is thick, smooth, reddish-yellow to reddish-brown, opening by
an irregular mouth. The plant is sessile and quite strongly rooted with fine rootlets.
Its habitat, with us, is along the banks of small brooks in the woods. It has
been classed heretofore as S. vulgare, smooth variety. I sent some to Prof. Peck,
who quite agrees that they should be separated from S. vulgare. Found from
August to November.</p>

</div>

<p>Geaster, so called because it has a star-like opening somewhat similar to the
genus Geaster.</p>

<p>Peridium subglobose, thick, with a very short stem, or almost&mdash;sometimes
entirely&mdash;sessile; hard, rough, splitting into irregular stellate limbs; frequently
well buried in the ground. Inner mass dark-brown or blackish, sometimes with
rather a purplish tinge. Some grow quite large with the peridium very thick.
My attention was first attracted by some of the peridium shells upon the ground on
Cemetery Hill. The plant is quite abundant there from September to December.</p>


<h3><i>Catastoma. Morgan.</i></h3>

<p>This is a small puffball-like plant, growing just beneath the ground and attached
to its bed by very small threads which issue from every part of the cortex,
which is quite thick. Breaking away at maturity in a circumscissile manner,
the lower part is held fast to the ground, while the upper part remains attached
to the inner peridium as a kind of cup. The inner peridium, with the top part
of the outer peridium attached, becomes loose and tumbles over the ground, the
mouth being in the base of the plant as it grew.</p>

  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 478.</span>&mdash;Catastoma circumscissum.</p>
</div>

<p>Circumscissum means divided into halves.</p>

<p>The peridium is usually round, more or less depressed, commonly rough
because of the soil attached; the larger part of the plant remaining in the soil as
a cup; the upper part with the inner peridium, depressed-globose, thin, pallid,
becoming gray, with branny
scales, with a small basal mouth.
A thin spongy layer will frequently
be seen between the outer
and inner peridium. The mass
of the spores is olivaceous, changing
to pale-brown. The spores
are round, minutely warted,
4&ndash;5Âµ. in diameter, often with very
short pedicels.</p>

<p>The plants are usually found in
pastures along paths. I have
seen them in several parts of
Ohio. They are found from
Maine to the western mountains.
This is called Bovista circumscissa
by Berkeley.</p>

<p>There is a species of a western
range called C. subterraneum.
This differs mainly in having larger spores. It seems to be confined to the middle
west. However, it does not grow under the ground, as its name would suggest.</p>

<p>There is also another species called C. pedicellatum. This species seems to
be confined to the southern states and differs mainly in the spores having marked
pedicels and closely warted.</p>


<h3><i>PodaxineÃ¦.</i></h3>

<p>This tribe is characterized by having a stalk continuous with the apex of the
peridium, forming an axis. Some of the plants are short stalked, some long
stalked. The tribe forms a natural connecting link between the Gastromycetes
and the Agarics. Thus: Podaxon is a true Gastromycetes, with capillitia mixed with
spores; Caulogossum, with its permanent gleba chambers, is close to the Hymenogasters;
Secotium is only a step from Caulogossum, the tramal plates being more
sinuate-lamellate; and Montagnites, which is usually placed with the Agarics, is
only a Gyrophragmium with the plates truly lamellate.</p>

<h3><i>Secotium. Kunz.</i></h3>

<p>This is a very interesting genus. When I found my first specimen I was
much in doubt whether it was an Agaric or a puffball, as it seemed to be a sort of
connecting link between the two classes. The genus is divided into smooth-spored
and rough-spored species, both having a stalk continuing, as an axis, to the apex
of the plant. The peridium is round or conical and it dehisces by breaking away
at the base. Secotium is from a Greek word meaning chamber.</p>

  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 479.</span>&mdash;Secotium acuminatum. Life size of small specimens.</p>
</div>

<p>This is an exceedingly variable species, as found about Chillicothe, yet the
variability extends only to the outward appearance of the plant; some are almost
round, slightly depressed, some (and a large majority) are inclined to be irregularly
cone-shaped.</p>

<p>The peridium is light-colored, of a soft texture, not brittle; it slowly expels
its spores by breaking away at the base; the stalk is usually short, but distinct
and prolonged to the apex of the peridium, forming an axis for the gleba. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span>
surface of the peridium is smooth, dingy-white or ash-colored, with minute white
spots, due to scales. It is of various shapes; acute-ovate, sometimes obtuse, nearly
spherical, sometimes slightly depressed and irregular cone-shaped. The gleba is
composed of semi-persistent cells, plainly seen with a glass or even with the naked
eye. It has no capillitium. The spores are globose and smooth, often apiculate.
This plant is quite abundant about Chillicothe, and I have found it from the first
of May to the last of October.</p>

<p>This species is widely distributed in America, and occurs in Northern Africa
and Eastern Europe.</p>


<h3><i>Polysaccum. DeC.</i></h3>

<p>Polysaccum is from <i>polus</i>, many, and <i>saccus</i>, a sack. Peridium irregularly
globose, thick, attenuated downward into a stem-like base, opening by disintegration
of its upper portion; internal mass or gleba divided into distinct sac-like cells.</p>

<p>Allied to Scleroderma and distinguished by the cavities of the gleba containing
distinct peridioles. <i>Massee.</i></p>


<h3><i>Polysaccum pisocarpium. Fr.</i></h3>

  </a>
  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 480.</span>&mdash;Polysaccum pisocarpium.</p>
</div>

<p>Pisocarpium is from two Greek words meaning pea and fruited.</p>

<p>Peridium irregularly globose, indistinctly nodulose, passing downward into
a stout stem-like base, peridioles irregularly angular, 4&ndash;5Ã—3Âµ, yellow. Spores
globose, warted, coffee-color, 9&ndash;13Âµ. <i>Massee.</i></p>

<p>I have found this plant only a few times about Chillicothe. Mr. Lloyd
identified it for me. It has very much the shape of a pear. The skin is quite
hard, smooth, olivaceous-black with yellow mottling patches not unlike the skin
of a rattlesnake. The peridioles, which are small ovate sacs bearing the spores
within, are very distinct. The interior of the plant when mature is dark, and it
breaks and disintegrates from the upper part very like C. cyathiformis. This
is a very interesting plant whose ovate sac-like cells will easily distinguish it.
Found from August to October, it delights in sandy soil, in pine or mixed woods.</p>


<h3><i>Mitremyces. Nees.</i></h3>

<p>Mitremyces is made up of two words: <i>mitre</i>, a cap; <i>myces</i>, a mushroom.
It is a small genus, there being but three species found in this country. The
spore-mass or gleba, in its young state, is surrounded by four layers. The outer
layer is gelatinous and behaves itself somewhat differently in each species. This
outer layer is known as the volva or volva-like peridium, which soon disappears.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span>
The next layer is called the exoperidium and is composed of two layers, the inner
one quite thin and cartilaginous&mdash;in M. cinnabarinus it is a bright red; this is
attached to a rather thick, gelatinous, outer layer which soon falls away, exposing
the endoperidium, which is the layer seen in older specimens. Within the endoperidium
are the spores, which are pale ochraceous or sulphur color, globose or
elliptical in shape. They are contained in a separate membrane or sac; when they
mature the sac contracts and forces the spores out into the air. The mycelium
of this plant is especially peculiar, being composed of a bundle of root-like strands,
translucent and jelly-like when young and fresh, but becoming tough and hard.
This genus is called by some authors Calostoma, meaning a beautiful mouth, a very
appropriate name, as the mouths of all American species are red and quite
beautiful.</p>


<h3><i>Mitremyces cinnabarinus. Desv.</i></h3>

  </a>
  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 481.</span>&mdash;Mitremyces cinnabarinus. Natural size.</p>
</div>

<p>The rooting strands are long, compact, dark when dry. Exporidium bright
red, smooth internally; the outer layer thick, gelatinous when fresh, finally breaking
into areas and curling inward. The separation is caused by the fact that the
cells of the thick gelatinous portion expand by the absorption of water,
while those of the inner layer do not, hence the rupture occurs. The endoperidium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span>
and rayed mouth are
bright red when fresh,
partially fading in old
specimens.</p>

<p>The spores are elliptical-oblong,
punctate-sculptured,
varying much as to
size in specimens from
different localities; 6&ndash;8Ã—10&ndash;14
in West Virginia
specimens. Massachusetts
specimens, 6&ndash;8Ã—12&ndash;20.
<i>Lloyd.</i></p>

<p>I have seen these specimens
growing in the
mountains in West Virginia.
They quickly arrest
the attention because of their bright red caps. They seem not, as yet, to have
crossed the Alleghenies&mdash;at least I have not found it in Ohio. It has a number
of synonyms: Scleroderma calostoma, Calostoma cinnabarinum, Lycoperdon
heterogeneum, L. calostoma.</p>

<p>The plants in Figure 481 were photographed by Dr. Kellerman. Mr. Geo. E.
Morris of Waltham, Mass., sent me some specimens early in August, 1907.</p>


<h3><i>Geaster. Mich.</i></h3>

<p>Geaster, an earth-star; so called because at maturity the outer coat breaks its
connection with the mycelium in the ground and bursts open like the petals of a
flower; then, becoming reflexed, those petals lift the inner ball from the ground
and it remains in the center of the expanded, star-like coat. The coat of the inner
ball is thin and papery, and opens by an apical mouth. The threads, or capillitium,
which bear the spores proceed from the walls of the peridium and form the central
columella. The threads are simple, long, slender, thickest in the middle and
tapering towards the ends, fixed at one end and free at the other.</p>

<p>The Geaster is a picturesque little plant which will arrest the attention of the
most careless observer. It is abundant and is frequently found in the late summer
and fall in woods and pastures.</p>


<h3><i>Geaster minimus. Schw.</i></h3>

  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 482.</span>&mdash;Geaster minimus. Natural size.</p>
</div>

<p>The outer coat or exoperidium recurved, segments acute at the apex, eight to
twelve segments divided to about the middle. Mycelial layer usually attached,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</a></span>
generally shaggy with fragments of leaves or grass, sometimes partly or entirely
separating. Fleshy layer closely attached, very light in color, usually smooth on
the limb of the exoperidium but cracked on the segments. Pedicel short but
distinct. The inner
peridium ovoid, one-fourth
to one-half
inch in diameter;
white to pale-brown,
sometimes almost
black. Mouth lifted
on a slight cone, lip
bordered with a
hair-like fringe;
columella slender, as
are also the threads.
Spores brown,
globe-shaped, and
minutely warted.
Found in the summer
and early fall.</p>

<p>Nature seems to
give it the power to
lift up the spore-bearing
body, the
better to eject its
spores to the wind. It is very frequently found in pastures all over the state. I
have found it in many localities about Chillicothe. It is called "minimus" because
it is the smallest Earth-star.</p>


<h3><i>Geaster hygrometricus. Pers.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Water-Measuring Earth-Star.</span></p>

<div class="floatr" style="width: 400px;">

  <p class="caption citation"><i>Photo by C. G. Lloyd.</i></p>
  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 483.</span>&mdash;Geaster hygrometricus. Natural size.</p>
</div>

<p>The unexpanded plant is nearly spherical. The mycelial layer is thin, tearing
away as the plant expands, the bark or skin falling with the mycelium. The outer
coat is deeply parted, the segments, acute at the apex, four to twenty; strongly
hygrometric, becoming reflexed when the plant is moist, strongly incurved when
the plant is dry. The inner coating is nearly spherical, thin, sessile, opening by
simply a torn aperture. There is no columella. The threads are transparent, much
branched, and interwoven. The spores are large, globose, and rough.</p>

<p>The plant ripens in the fall and the thick outer peridium divides into segments,
the number varying from four to twenty. When the weather is wet the
lining of the points of the segments become gelatinous and recurve, and the points<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</a></span>
rest upon the ground, holding the inner ball from the ground. In dry weather the
soft gelatinous lining becomes hard and the segments curve in and clasp the inner
ball. Hence its name, "hygrometricus," a measurer of moisture. The plant is
quite general.</p>

  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 484.</span>&mdash;Geaster Archeri.</p>
</div>

<p>Young plant acute. Exoperidium cut beyond the middle into seven to nine
acute segments. In herbarium specimens usually saccate but sometimes revolute.
Mycelial layer closely adherent, compared to previous species relatively smooth.
As in the previous species the mycelium covers the young plant but is not so
strongly developed, so that the adhering dirt is not so evident on the mature plant.
Fleshy layer when dry, thin and closely adherent. Endoperidium globose, sessile.
Mouth sulcate, indefinite. Columella globose-clavate. Capillitium thicker than
the spores. Spores small, 4 mc. almost smooth. <i>Lloyd.</i></p>

<p>I first found the plant in the young state. The acute point, which will be seen
in the photograph, puzzled me. I marked the place where it grew and in a few
days found the developed Geaster. The plant is reddish-brown and it differs from
other species "with sulcate mouths, in its closely sessile endoperidium." I have
found the plant several times in Hayne's Hollow, near Chillicothe. I found it in
the tracks of decayed logs.</p>

<p>The plant has been called Geaster Morganii in this country but had previously
been named from Australia.</p>

<p>Exoperidium revolute, cut to about the middle in eight to ten segments.
Both mycelial and fleshy layers are more closely adherent than in most species.
Pedicel <i>short</i> and <i>thick</i>. Inner peridium subglobose, <i>verrucose</i>. Mouth conical,
beaked, strongly sulcate, seated on a depressed zone. Columella prominent, persistent.
Capillitium threads simple, long tapering. Spores globose, rough.</p>

<p>The characteristic of this plant is the verrucose inner peridium. Under a
glass of low power it appears as though the peridium were densely covered with
grains of sharp sand. This plant alone has this characteristic, to our knowledge;
and although it is indicated in the figures of G. cornatus of both Schaeffer and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</a></span>
Schmidel, we think that there it is only an exaggeration of the very <i>minute</i>
granular appearance cornatus has. The word "asper" is the first descriptive
adjective applied by Michelius. Fries included it in his complex striatus. <i>Lloyd.</i></p>

<p>I have found the plant frequently about Chillicothe. The plants represented
were photographed by Mr. Lloyd.</p>

  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Plate LXVI. Figure 486.&mdash;Geaster triplex.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The unexpanded plant acute. Exoperidium recurved (or, when not fully
expanded, somewhat saccate at base), cut to the middle (or usually two-thirds)
in five to eight segments. Mycelial layer adnate. Fleshy layer generally peeling
off from the segments of the fibrillose layer but usually remaining partially free,
as a cup at base of inner peridium. Inner peridium subglobose, closely sessile.
Mouth definite, fibrillose, broadly conical. Columella prominent, elongated.
Threads thicker than spores. Spores globose, roughened, 3&ndash;6 mc. <i>Lloyd</i>, in
Mycological Notes.</p>

<p>The color of Geaster triplex is reddish-brown. Notice the remains of a fleshy
layer forming a cup at base of inner peridium, a point which distinguishes this
species and which gives name to the species&mdash;triplex, three folds or apparently
three layers. The photograph was made by Dr. Kellerman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</a></span></p>

<p>The unexpanded plant is globose. Mycelium is universal. Exoperidium cut
in six to ten segments about half way, the limb deeply saccate. Mycelial layer
adnate to fibrillose. Fleshy layer, when dry, thin, adnate. Inner peridium sessile,
globose, with a determinate fibrillose mouth.</p>

<p>The spores are globose, almost smooth. <i>Lloyd.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Lloyd thinks this plant is practically the same as the G. fimbriatus of
Europe, differing from it in being more deeply saccate and having a determinate
mouth. This plant is very common on all the wooded hillsides about Chillicothe.
I have seen the ground on the top of Mt. Logan almost completely covered with
them. They are identified by Mr. Lloyd, Prof. Atkinson, and Dr. Peck. The
plants in Figure 487 were photographed by Mr. Lloyd from typical specimens.</p>

<p>Unexpanded plants globose, sometimes slightly pointed at apex. Mycelium
basal. Outer layer rigid, membranaceous, firm, light colored in the American plant.
The surface is covered with short, dense, appressed velumen, so that to the eye

a glass of low power.</p>

<p>The outer surface separates from the inner as the plant expands, and in
mature specimens is usually partly free. The thickness and texture of the two
layers are about the same. The fleshy layer is dark reddish-brown when dry, a
thin adnate layer. Inner peridium sessile, dark colored, globose, with a broad
base and pointed mouth. Mouth even, marked with a definite circular light-colored
basal zone. Columella elongated, clavate. Spores globose, almost smooth, small,

<p>Exporidium usually recurved, cut to about the middle into six to ten lobes; if
collected and dried when first open, rather firm and rigid; when exposed to weather
becoming like parchment paper by the peeling off of the inner and outer layers.
Inner peridium, subglobose, supported on several more or less confluent pedicels.
Surface minutely roughened; mouths several, appressed fibrillose, round, plain or
slightly elevated; columellÃ¦ several, filiform, probably the same in number as the
pedicels; spores globose, roughened, 3&ndash;6 mc.; capillitium simple, unbranched, long,
tapering, about half diameter of spores.</p>

<p>The inner peridium with its several mouths can be, not inaptly, compared to a
"pepper-box." The specific name is derived from the Latin <i>colum</i>, a strainer, and
the old English name we find in Berkeley "Cullender puffball" refers to a cullender
(or colander more modern form) now almost obsolete in English, but meaning a
kind of strainer. <i>Lloyd.</i></p>

<p>Found in sandy soil. It is quite rare. Both the generic and specific names
refer to its many mouths. The specimens in Figure 490 were found on Green
Island, Lake Erie, one of the points where this rare species is found. It is found
at Cedar Point, Ohio, also. The plant was photographed by Prof. Schaffner of

<h3><i>Cordyceps. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>Cordyceps is from a Greek word meaning a club and a Latin word meaning
a head. It is a genus of Pyrenomycetous fungi of which a few grow upon other
fungi, but by far the greater number are parasitic upon insects or their larva, as
will be seen in Figure 491.</p>

<p>The spores enter the breathing openings along the sides of the larva and the
mycelium grows until it fills the interior of the larva and kills it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[Pg 574]</a></span></p>

<p>In fructification a stalk rises from the body of the insect or larva and in the
enlarged extremity of this the perithecia are grouped. The stroma is vertical and
fleshy, head distinct, hyaline or colored; sporidia repeatedly divided and sub-moniliform.</p>


<h3><i>Cordyceps Herculea.</i> (<i>Schw.</i>) <i>Sacc.</i></h3>

  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 491.</span>&mdash;Cordyceps herculea. Showing
the grub upon which this species grows.</p>
</div>

<p>Herculea is so called from its large size.
The halftone will readily identify this species.
The plant is quite large, clavate in form, the
head oblong, round, slightly tapering upward
with a decided protuberance at the
apex, as will be seen in Figure 491. The
head is a light yellow in all specimens I
found, not alutaceous as Schw. states, nor is
the head obtuse. I found several specimens
on a sidehill in Haynes's Hollow in August
and September, all growing from bodies of
the large white grubs which are found about
rotten wood. They were found during wet
weather. They were identified by both Dr.
Peck and Dr. Herbst.</p>


<h3><i>Cordyceps militaris. Fr.</i></h3>

<div class="floatr" style="width: 347px;">
 <a name="image492" id="image492"></a>

  </a>
  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 492.</span>&mdash;Cordyceps militaris.</p>
</div>

<p>This is much smaller and more common
than C. Herculea. Conidia&mdash;SubcÃ¦spitose,
white; stem distinct, simple, becoming
smooth; clubs incrassated, mealy; Conidia
globose. Ascophore&mdash;Fleshy, orange-red;
head clavate, tuberculose; stem equal;
sporidia long, breaking up into joints. This is frequently called Torrubia militaris.</p>

<p>It is known as the caterpillar fungus. Its spores are cylindrical and are
produced upon orange-red fruiting bodies in the fall. As soon as the spore falls
on the caterpillar it sends out germ-threads which penetrate the caterpillar. Here
the threads form long narrow spores which break off and form other spores until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[Pg 575]</a></span>
the body-cavity is entirely filled. The caterpillar soon becomes sluggish and dies.
The fungus continues to grow until it has completely appropriated all of the
insect's soft parts, externally a perfect caterpillar but internally completely filled
with mycelial threads. Under favorable conditions this mycelial caterpillar, which
has become a storage
organ, will send up an
orange-red club-shaped
body, as will be seen in
Figure 492, and will
produce the kind of
spores described above.
Under some conditions
this mycelial caterpillar
may be made to produce
a dense growth of
threads from its entire
surface, looking like a
small white ball, and
from these threads another
kind of spore is
formed. These spores
are pinched off in great
numbers and will germinate
in the larva the
same as the sac spore.
The specimens were
found by Mrs. E. B.
Blackford near Boston,
and photographed by
Dr. Kellerman.</p>

<p>This plant is fleshy, capitate, head ovate, bay-brown, stem yellow, then
blackish.</p>

<p>This plant is parasitic on Elaphomyces granulatus. It is shown at the base
of the stem of the plant. It grows two or three inches under the surface and
somewhat resembles a truffle in appearance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</a></span></p>

<p>Both are very interesting plants. The plant in Figure 493 was found near
Boston, Mass. They are usually found in pine woods, often in tufts. The stems
are from one to four inches long, nearly equal, smooth, lemon-colored, at length
fibroso-strigose and blackish.</p>

<p>It is sometimes called Torrubia capitata.</p>

MYXOMYCETES.</h2>


<p>The plants under this head belong to the slime-moulds and at first are wholly
gelatinous. All the species and genera are small and easily overlooked, yet they
are intensely interesting when carefully observed. In the morning you may see
a mass of gelatinous matter and in the evening a beautiful net work of threads and
spores, the transformation being so rapid. This gelatinous mass is known as
protoplasm or plasmodium, and the motive power of the plasmodium has suggested
to many that they should be placed in the animal kingdom, or called fungus
animals. The same is true of Schizomycetes, to which all the bacteria, bacillus,
spirillum, and vibrio, and a number of other groups belong. I have only a few
Myxomycetes to present. I have watched the development of a number of plants
of this group, but because of the scarcity of literature upon the subject I have been
unable to identify them satisfactorily.</p>


<h3><i>Lycogala epidendrum. Fr.</i></h3>

  </a>
  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 494.</span>&mdash;Lycogala epidendrum.</p>
</div>

<p>This is called the Stump Lycogala. It is quite common, seeming in a certain
stage to be a small puffball. The peridium has a double membrane, papery, per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</a></span>sistent,
bursting irregularly at the apex; externally minutely warty, nearly round,
blood-red or pinkish, then brownish; mouth irregular; spores becoming pale, or
violet.</p>


<h3><i>Reticularia maxima. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>This is quite common on partially decayed logs. The peridium is very thin,
tuberculose, effused, delicate, olivaceous-brown; spores olive, echinulate or spiny.</p>


<h3><i>Didymius xanthopus. Fr.</i></h3>

<p>These are very small yellow-stemmed plants, found on oak leaves in wet
weather. The sporangium has an inner membranaceous peridium; the whole is
round, brown, whitish. The stem is elongated, even, yellow. The columella is
stipitate into the sporangia.</p>


<h3><i>D. cinereum. Fr.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</a></span></h3>

<p>Sporangia sessile, round, whitish, covered with an ashy-gray scurf. Spores
black. Very small. On fallen oak leaves. Easily overlooked.</p>


<h3><i>Xylaria. Schrank.</i></h3>

<p>Xylaria means pertaining
to wood. It is usually
vertical, more or less
stipitate. The stroma is
between fleshy and
corky, covered with a
black or rufous bark.</p>


<h3><i>Xylaria polymorpha.
Grev.</i></h3>

<div class="fcenter">

  </a>
  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 495.</span>&mdash;Xylaria polymorpha. Natural size.</p>
</div>

<p>Polymorpha means
many forms. It is nearly
fleshy, a number usually
growing together, or
gregarious; thickened as
if swollen, irregular;
dirty-white, then black;
the receptacle bearing
perithecia in every part.</p>

<p>This plant is quite
common in our woods,
growing about old
stumps or on decayed
sticks or pieces of wood.
The spore-openings can
be seen with an ordinary
hand-glass.</p>


<h3><i>Xylaria polymorpha, var. spathularia.</i></h3>

  </a>
  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 496.</span>&mdash;Xylaria polymorpha var. spathularia. Natural size.</p>
</div>

<p>Spathularia means in the form of a spathula or spatula. It is vertical and
stipitate, the stem being more definite than in the X. polymorpha, the stroma being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[Pg 580]</a></span>
between fleshy and corky, frequently growing in numbers or gregarious, turgid,
fairly regular, dirty-white, then brownish-red, finally black. An ordinary hand
glass will show how it bears perithecia in all its parts. This will be clearly seen
in the section on the right.</p>

<p>These plants are not as common as the X. polymorpha, but are found in
habitats similar to those of the other plant, particularly around maple stumps or
upon decayed maple branches.</p>


<h3><i>Stemonitis. Gled.</i></h3>

<p>Stemonitis is from a Greek word which means stamen, one of the essential
organs of a flower. This is a genus of myxomycetous fungi, giving name to the
family StemonitaceÃ¦, which has a single sporangium or Ã¦thalium; without the
peculiar deposits of lime carbonate which characterize the fructification of other
orders, and the spores, capillitium, and columella are usually uniformly black, or
brownish.</p>


<h3><i>Stemonitis fusca. Roth.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[Pg 581]</a></span></h3>

  </a>
  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 497.</span>&mdash;Stemonitis fusca. Natural size.</p>
</div>

<p>Fusca means dark-brown, smoky. The sporangia are cylindrical and pointed
at the apex, peridia fugacious, exposing the beautiful net-work of the capillitium.
The reticulate capillitium springs from the dark, penetrating stem.</p>

<p>This is a very beautiful plant when studied with an ordinary hand-glass.
I have frequently seen an entire log covered with this plant.</p>


<h3><i>Stemonitis ferruginea. Ehrb.</i></h3>

<p>Ferruginea means rust color. The sporangia is very similar to that of S.
fusca, cylindrical, peridium fugacious, exposing the reticulate capillitium, but
instead of being dark-brown it is a yellowish or rusty-brown color.</p>

RECIPES FOR COOKING MUSHROOMS.</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Mushrooms. No. 1.</span></h3>

<p>Choose them as nearly as possible of uniform size and free from insects. Drop
them in salt water for five minutes to free them from any insects that may be
hidden in the gills; drain them and wipe dry and clean with a rather rough cloth;
cut off the stems close to the cap. Put them into a granite or porcelain saucepan,
cover closely and stew gently fifteen minutes. Salt to taste. Rub a tablespoonful
of butter into about a tablespoonful of flour, and stir this into the mushrooms,
letting boil three or four minutes; stir in three tablespoonfuls of cream, mixed
with a well-beaten egg, and stir the whole for two minutes without letting it boil,
and serve either on toast or as a vegetable.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Mushrooms. No. 2.</span></h3>

<p>Clean mushrooms as directed above and stew in water ten minutes; then
drain off part of the water and put in as much warm milk as you have poured off
water; let this stew for five to ten minutes; then add some drawn butter, or veal or
chicken gravy, and salt and pepper to taste. Thicken with a little corn starch wet
in cold milk. Serve hot.</p>

<p>In cooking mushrooms they should always be kept as closely covered as
possible in order the better to retain the flavor, and they should never be subjected
to too great heat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Mushrooms.</span></h3>

<p>Be sure your mushrooms are fresh and free from insects; cut off the stems
close to the caps and wipe the tops with a wet cloth. Arrange them in a pie dish
with the gills uppermost, laying a little bit of butter on each; sprinkle pepper, salt,
and a very little mace upon them. Put them into a hot oven and bake from
fifteen minutes to half an hour, according to the tenderness of the mushrooms; if
they are in danger of getting too dry baste them occasionally with butter and
water. Pour over them some <i>maitre d'hotel</i> sauce and send to the table in the dish
in which they were baked.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Broiled Mushrooms.</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[Pg 583]</a></span></h3>

<p>Select the finest and freshest you can get and prepare as for baking; put into
a deep dish and pour over them some melted butter, turning them over and over in
it. Salt and pepper and let them lie for an hour and a half in the butter. Put
them, gills uppermost, on an oyster gridiron over a clear hot fire, turning them
over as one side browns. Put them on a hot dish, having them well seasoned with
butter, pepper, and salt and with a few drops of lemon juice squeezed upon each,
if liked.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mushroom and Veal Ragout.</span></h3>

<p>Take equal quantities of cold veal steak or roast veal and small puffballs or
other mushrooms, and mince all fine; mince a small onion and put with the mushrooms
and meat into a pan with some cold veal gravy, if you have it, and water
enough to cover the mixture. Add a tablespoonful of butter, pepper and salt
well, and let the mixture cook until it is almost dry, stirring it frequently to keep
it from scorching; it should cook fully half an hour. When almost done, add a
large tablespoonful of good catsup, or Worcestershire sauce if preferred.
Serve hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mushroom PatÃ©s.</span></h3>

<p>Wash mushrooms well, cut them into small pieces and drop them in salt
water for five minutes. Have ready in a pan upon the stove about two ounces of
butter to each pint of mushrooms, having pan and butter very hot but not scorching;
dip the mushrooms from the salt water with a skimmer and drop them into
the hot butter; cover them closely to retain the flavor, shaking the pan or stirring
them over to keep them from scorching or sticking. Let them cook with moderate
heat from fifteen to thirty minutes, according to the tenderness of the mushrooms.
Remove the cover from the pan, draw the mushrooms to one side and lift the pan
on one side so that the gravy will run down to the opposite side; stir into the
gravy a level tablespoonful of sifted flour, and rub this smooth with the gravy;
then add a half a pint of rich milk or cream; stir the mushrooms into this and
allow it to boil for a minute. Have ready in the oven some patÃ© shells, fill them
with the mushrooms, seasoned to taste with salt and pepper, and set back in the
oven for a few minutes to heat before serving. These are especially fine when
made of Tricholoma personatum or Pleurotus ostreatus, but many other varieties
will answer well.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Beefsteak With Mushroom Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Have your sirloin steak cut an inch or more thick, put into an exceedingly hot
baking pan on top of the stove, in one minute turn steak over so that both sides will
be seared. Put the pan into an exceedingly hot oven and allow it to remain for
twenty minutes.</p>

<p>Have ready in a saucepan two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, heat well and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[Pg 584]</a></span>
add two cupfuls of fresh, clean mushrooms which have been allowed to stand in
salt water for a period of five minutes; cover closely and cook briskly without
burning for ten minutes; set on the back of the stove (after having seasoned them
properly with salt and pepper) to keep hot until ready to use. Place the steak
upon a hot dish, pour the mushrooms over it and send to the table at once. It is a
dish fit for a king.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stuffed Morels.</span></h3>

<p>Choose the freshest and best morels; cleanse them thoroughly by allowing
the water from the faucet to run on them; open the stalk at the bottom; fill with
veal stuffing, anchovy or any rich forcemeat you choose, securing the ends and
dressing between slices of bacon; bake for a half an hour, basting with butter and
water, and serve with the gravy which comes from them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Morels.</span></h3>

<p>Wash a dozen morels carefully and cut off the ends of the stems. Split the
mushrooms and put them into a pan in which two tablespoonfuls of butter have
been melted. Cover closely and cook with a moderate heat for fifteen minutes.
Mix two teaspoonfuls of corn starch in a half a pint of fresh milk and pour into
the pan with the mushrooms, allowing it to boil for a minute or two; salt and
pepper to taste and serve hot, upon toast if liked.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Cook Boleti.</span></h3>

<p>Cut off the stems, and remove the spore-tubes, after having wiped the caps
clean with a damp cloth. They may be broiled in a hot buttered pan, turning them
frequently until done, which will be about fifteen minutes. Dust with salt and
pepper and put bits of butter over them as you would on broiled beefsteak.</p>

<p>They may be stewed in a little water in a covered saucepan, after being cut
into pieces of equal size. Stew for twenty minutes and when done add pepper,
salt, butter or cream.</p>

<p>Or they may be fried, after being sliced as you would egg plant, and dipped
in batter or rolled in egg and cracker crumbs.</p>

<p>In preparing Boleti the spore tube should be removed unless very young, as
they will make the dish slimy.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mushroom Catsup.</span></h3>

<p>To two quarts of mushrooms allow a quarter of a pound of salt. The full
grown mushrooms are better in making this as they afford more juice. Put a
layer of mushrooms in the bottom of a stone jar, sprinkle with salt; then another
layer of mushrooms till you have used all; let them lie thus for six hours, then
break them into bits. Set in a cool place for three days, stirring thoroughly every
morning. Strain the juice from them, and to every quart allow half an ounce of
allspice, the same quantity of ginger, half a teaspoonful of powdered mace and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[Pg 585]</a></span>
half a teaspoonful of cayenne. Put it into a stone jar, cover it closely, set
it in a saucepan of water over the fire, and boil hard for five hours. Take it off,
empty it into a porcelain kettle and let it boil slowly for half an hour longer. Set
it in a cool place and let it stand all night until settled and clear, then pour off
carefully from the sediment, into small bottles, filling them to the mouth. Cork
tightly and seal carefully. Keep in a dry, cool, dark closet.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mushrooms With Bacon.</span></h3>

<p>Take some full-grown mushrooms, and, having cleaned them, procure a few
rashers of nice streaky bacon and fry it in the usual manner. When nearly done
add a dozen or so of mushrooms and fry them slowly until they are cooked. In
the cooking they will absorb all the fat of the bacon, and with the addition of a
little salt and pepper will form a most appetizing breakfast relish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hydnum.</span></h3>

<p>The Hydnums are sometimes slightly bitter and it is well to boil them for a
few minutes and then throw away the water. Drain the mushrooms carefully;
add pepper and salt, butter, and milk; cook in a covered saucepan slowly for
twenty or twenty-five minutes; have ready some slices of toast, pour the
mushrooms over these and serve at once.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Oyster Mushrooms.</span></h3>

<p>One of the best ways to cook an Oyster mushroom is to fry it as you fry an
oyster. Use the tender part of the Oyster mushroom; clean thoroughly; add
pepper and salt; dip in beaten egg and then bread crumbs and fry in fat or butter.
Or parboil them for forty-five minutes, drain, roll in flour and fry.</p>

<p>The Oyster mushroom is also excellent when stewed.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lepiota procera.</span></h3>

<p>Clean the caps with a damp cloth and cut off the stem close to the caps; broil
lightly on both sides over a clear fire or in a very hot pan, turning the mushrooms
carefully three or four times; have ready some freshly-made, well-buttered toast;
arrange the mushrooms on the toast and put a small piece of butter on each and
sprinkle with pepper and salt; set in the oven or before a brisk fire to melt the
butter, then serve quickly.</p>

<p>Some persons think that slices of bacon toasted over the mushrooms improve
the flavor.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beefsteak Smothered in Mushrooms.</span></h3>

<p>Have ready a sufficient quantity of full-grown mushrooms, carefully cleaned;
cut them in pieces and put into a baking pan with a tablespoonful of butter to
two cupfuls of mushrooms, sprinkle with pepper and salt, and bake in a moderate
oven forty-five minutes. Broil your steak until it is almost done; then put it into
the pan with a part of the mushrooms under and the remainder over the steak;
put it into the oven again and allow it to remain for ten minutes; turn out upon a
hot dish and serve quickly.</p>

<p>Agaricus, Lepiota, Coprinus, Lactarius, Tricholoma, and Russula are especially
fine for this method of preparation.</p>

CULTIVATION OF THE MUSHROOM.</h2>

<p class="center">BY PROF. LAMBERT,</p>

<p class="center">The American Spawn Co., St. Paul, Minn.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[Pg 587]</a></span><b>GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.</b>&mdash;Commercially, and in a restricted sense,
the term "mushroom" is generally used indiscriminately to designate the species
of fungi which are edible and susceptible of cultivation. The varieties which
have been successfully cultivated for the market are nearly all derived from
<i>Agaricus campestris</i>, <i>Agaricus villaticus</i>, <i>and Agaricus Arvensis</i>. They may be
white, cream or creamy-white, or brown; but the color is not always a permanent
characteristic, it is often influenced by surrounding conditions.</p>

<p>Mushrooms are grown for the market on a large scale in France and in
England. It is estimated that nearly twelve million pounds of fresh mushrooms
are sold every year at the Central Market of Paris. A large quantity of mushrooms
are canned and exported from France to every civilized country. This
industry has recently made remarkable progress in the United States, and fresh
mushrooms are now regularly quoted on the markets of our large cities. They
are sold at prices ranging from twenty-five cents to one dollar and fifty cents
per pound, according to season, demand and supply.</p>

<p><b>ESSENTIAL CONDITIONS.</b>&mdash;Mushrooms can be grown in any climate
and in any season where the essential conditions may be found, obtained or controlled.
These conditions are, <i>first</i>, a temperature ranging from 53Â° to 60Â° F.,
with extremes of 50Â° to 63Â°; <i>second</i>, an atmosphere saturated (but not dripping)
with moisture; <i>third</i>, proper ventilation; <i>fourth</i>, a suitable medium or bed; <i>fifth</i>,
good spawn. It may be seen that in the open air, these conditions are rarely
found together for any length of time. It is therefore necessary, in order to
grow mushrooms on a commercial basis, that one or more of these elements be
artificially supplied or controlled. This is usually done in cellars, caves, mines,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[Pg 588]</a></span>
greenhouses, or specially constructed mushroom houses. A convenient disposition
of the shelves in a cellar is shown in Figure 498. A large installation for
commercial purposes is shown in Figure 500, and a specially constructed cellar is
shown in Figure 499. Where abandoned mines, natural or artificial caves are
available, the required atmospheric conditions are often found combined and may
be uniformly maintained throughout the year.</p>

<p><b>TEMPERATURE.</b>&mdash;Within the limits prescribed, the temperature should
be uniform throughout the growth of the crop. When too cold, the development
of the spawn will be retarded or arrested. A high temperature will favor the
development of molds and bacteria which will soon destroy the spawn or the
growing crop. The cultivation of the mushroom, as a summer crop, is therefore
greatly restricted. As a fall, winter or spring crop it may be grown wherever
means are at hand to raise the temperature to about 58Â° F. Many florists are
utilizing the waste space under the benches for that purpose; they have the advantage
of being able to use the expended material of mushroom beds in growing
flowers.</p>


<p><b>MOISTURE.</b>&mdash;Moisture is an important factor in the cultivation of the
mushroom, and demands intelligent application. The mushroom requires an
atmosphere nearly saturated with moisture, and yet the direct application of
water on the beds is more or less injurious to the growing crop. It is therefore
essential that the beds, when made, contain the requisite amount of moisture,
and that this moisture be not lost by excessive evaporation. They should be
protected from a dry atmosphere or strong draughts. Where watering becomes
necessary, it should be applied in a fine spray around the beds with a view of
restoring the moisture to the atmosphere, and on the beds after the mushrooms
have been gathered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[Pg 589]</a></span></p>


<p><b>VENTILATION.</b>&mdash;Pure air is essential to a healthy crop. Provision should
therefore be made for a gradual renewal of the air in the mushroom house.
However, draughts must be avoided as tending to a too rapid evaporation and
cooling of the beds, an unfortunate condition which cannot thereafter be entirely
remedied.</p>


<p><b>THE BEDS.</b>&mdash;The most common type of beds is known as the "flat bed."
It is made on the floor or on shelves as shown in the illustrations. It is usually
about 10 inches deep. Another type, principally used in France, is known as
the "ridge bed," and requires more labor than the flat bed. The mushroom house
and shelves, if used, should be frequently disinfected and whitewashed in order
to avoid danger from insects and bacteria. The preparation of the beds and
subsequent operations will be shown in connection with the other subjects.</p>


<p><b>PREPARATION OF THE MANURE.</b>&mdash;The best manure is obtained from
horses fed with an abundance of dry and nitrogenous food. The manure of
animals fed on greens is undesirable. Growers do not all follow the same method
of fermenting or composting the manure. When first unloaded, the manure is
left in its original state for a few days. It is then piled in heaps about three
feet deep and well pressed down. In this operation the material should be carefully
forked and well mixed, and wherever found too dry, it should be lightly
sprinkled. It is allowed to remain in that condition for about six days when
it is again well forked and turned. In the latter operation it receives an additional
light sprinkling; the dry portions are turned inside in order that the whole
mass may be homogenous and uniformly moist, and the heap is again raised to
about three feet. About six days later the operation is repeated, and in about
three days the manure should be ready for the beds. It is then of a dark brown
color mixed with white, free from objectionable odor. It is unctuous, elastic and
moist, though not wet, and should not leave any moisture in the hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[Pg 590]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course, the above rules are subject to modification according to the condition
of the manure, its age and previous handling.</p>


<p><b>SPAWNING.</b>&mdash;The manure, having been properly composted, is spread
evenly on the floor or shelves and firmly compressed in beds about ten inches
in depth. The temperature of the bed is then too high for spawning and will
usually rise still higher. It should be carefully watched with the aid of a special
or mushroom thermometer. When the temperature of the beds has fallen to
about 75Â° or 80Â°, they may be spawned. The beds must be spawned when the
temperature falls, never when it rises. The bricks of spawn are broken into
eight or ten pieces, and these pieces are inserted from one to two inches below
the surface, about nine to twelve inches apart. The bed is then firmly compressed.
An advantage is found in breaking and distributing the spawn over
the surface of the bed a few days before spawning; this allows the mycelium to
absorb some moisture and swell to some extent. If the bed is in proper condition
it should not require watering for several weeks.</p>

</div>


<p><b>CASING THE BEDS.</b>&mdash;As soon as the spawn is observed to "run," or
from eight days to two weeks, the beds are "cased" or covered with a layer of
about one inch of light garden loam, well screened. The loam should be slightly
moist, and free from organic matter. The beds should now be watched and
should not be allowed to evaporate or dry out.</p>


<p><b>PICKING.</b>&mdash;Mushrooms should appear in from five to ten weeks after
spawning, and the period of production of a good bed ranges from two to four
months. In picking the mushrooms an intelligent hand will carefully twist it
from the soil and fill the hole left in the bed with fresh soil. Pieces of roots or
stems should never be allowed to remain in the beds, otherwise decay might set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[Pg 591]</a></span>
in and infect the surrounding plants. A good mushroom bed will yield a crop
of from one-half to two pounds per square foot. Mushrooms should be picked
every day or every other day; they should not be left after the veils begin to break.</p>

<p>For the market the mushrooms are sorted as to size and color, and packed
in one, two or five-pound boxes or baskets. Since they are very perishable, they
must reach the market in the shortest time.</p>


<p><b>OLD BEDS.</b>&mdash;It is not practicable to raise another crop of mushrooms in
the material of an old bed, although this material is still valuable for garden
purposes. The old material should be entirely removed, and the mushroom
house thoroughly cleaned before the new beds are made. If this precaution be
omitted the next crop may suffer from the diseases or enemies of the mushrooms.</p>

<p><b>SPAWN.</b>&mdash;The cultivated mushroom is propagated from "spawn," the commercial
name applied to the mycelium; the term "spawn" includes both the mycelium
and the medium in which it is carried and preserved. Spawn may be pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</a></span>cured
in the market in two forms, flake spawn and brick spawn. In both forms
the mycelium growth is started on a prepared medium mainly consisting of
manure and then arrested and dried. The flake spawn is short-lived by reason
of its loose form, in which the mycelium is easily accessible to the air and destructive
bacteria. It deteriorates rapidly in transportation and storage and can
only be used to advantage when fresh. Growers, especially in the United States,
have therefore discarded it in favor of brick spawn, which affords more protection
to the mycelium and can be safely transported and stored for a reasonable
period.</p>

<p>Until recently the manufacturer of spawn was compelled to rely entirely
upon the caprice of nature for his supply. The only method known consisted
in gathering the wild spawn wherever nature had deposited it and running the
same into bricks or in loose material, without reference to variety. Neither the
manufacturer nor the grower had any means of ascertaining the probable nature
of the crop until the mushrooms appeared.</p>

<p><b>PURE CULTURE SPAWN.</b>&mdash;The recent discovery of pure culture spawn
in this country has made possible the selection and improvement of varieties of
cultivated mushrooms with special reference to their hardiness, color, size, flavor
and prolificness, and the elimination of inferior or undesirable fungi in the crop.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[Pg 593]</a></span>
The scope of this article precludes a description of the pure culture method of
making spawn. It is now used by the large commercial growers and has in
many sections entirely superseded the old English spawn and other forms of
wild spawn. As now manufactured it resembles much in appearance the old
English spawn (see Figure 501). Some remarkable results have been obtained
by the use of pure culture spawn. We illustrate a cluster of fifty mushrooms
on one root grown by Messrs. Miller &amp; Rogers, of Mortonville, Pa., from "Lambert's
Pure Culture Spawn" produced by the American Spawn Company, of St.
Paul, Minn. (Figure 502). Several promising varieties have already been developed
by the new method, and can now be reproduced at will. Figure 503 is a
good illustration of <i>Agaricus villaticus</i>, a fleshy species in good demand. Figure
504 shows a bed of mushrooms grown from pure culture spawn in a sand rock
cave, using the flat bed.</p>

<p><b>HOW TO COOK MUSHROOMS.</b>&mdash;To the true epicure there are but four
ways of cooking mushrooms&mdash;broiling, roasting, frying them in sweet butter and
stewing them in cream.</p>

<p>In preparing fresh mushrooms for cooking, wash them as little as possible,
as washing robs them of their delicate flavor. Always bear in mind that the
more simply mushrooms are cooked the better they are. Like all delicately
flavored foods, they are spoiled by the addition of strongly flavored condiments.</p>


<p><b>Broiled Mushrooms.</b>&mdash;Select fine, large flat mushrooms, and be sure that
they are fresh. If they are dusty just dip them in cold salt water. Then lay
on cheese cloth and let them drain thoroughly. When they are dry cut off the
stem quite close to the comb. Or, what is better, carefully break off the stem.
Do not throw away the stems. Save them for stewing, for soup or for mushroom
sauce. Having cut or broken off the stems, take a sharp silver knife and
skin the mushrooms, commencing at the edge and finishing at the top. Put
them on a gridiron that has been well rubbed with sweet butter. Lay the mushrooms
on the broiling iron with the combs upward. Put a small quantity of
butter, a little salt and pepper in the center of each comb from where the stem
has been removed and let the mushrooms remain over the fire until the butter
melts. Then serve them on thin slices of buttered and well browned toast, which
should be cut round or diamond shape.</p>

<p>Serve the mushrooms just as quickly as possible after they are broiled, as
they must be eaten when hot. So nourishing are broiled mushrooms that with
a light salad they form a sufficient luncheon for anyone.</p>


<p><b>Fried Mushrooms.</b>&mdash;Clean and prepare the mushrooms as for broiling.
Put some sweet, unsalted butter in a frying pan&mdash;enough to swim the mushrooms
in. Stand the frying pan on a quick fire, and when the butter is at boiling heat
carefully drop the mushrooms in and let them fry three minutes, and serve them
on thin slices of buttered toast.</p>

<p>Serve a sauce of lemon juice, a little melted butter, salt and red pepper with
fried mushrooms.</p>

<p><b>Stewed Mushrooms.</b>&mdash;Stewed mushrooms after the following recipe make
one of the most delicious of breakfast dishes: It is not necessary to use large
mushrooms for stewing&mdash;small button ones will do. Take the mushrooms left
in the basket after having selected those for broiling, and also use the stems cut
from the mushrooms prepared for boiling. After cleaning and skinning them
put them in cold water with a little vinegar, and let them stand half an hour. If
you have a quart of mushrooms, put a tablespoonful of nice fresh butter in a
stewpan and stand it on the stove. When the butter begins to bubble drop the
mushrooms in the pan, and after they have cooked a minute season them well
with salt and black pepper. Now take hold of the handle of the stewpan and,
while the mushrooms are gently and slowly cooking, shake the pan almost constantly
to keep the butter from getting brown and the mushrooms from sticking.
After they have cooked eight minutes pour in enough rich, sweet cream to cover
the mushrooms to the depth of half an inch, and let them cook about eight or
ten minutes longer. Serve them in a very hot vegetable dish. Do not thicken
the cream with flour or with anything. Just cook them in this simple way. You
will find them perfect.</p>

<p>Resplendens means shining brightly.</p>

<p>The pileus is fleshy, convex, then nearly plane, even, bare, viscid, white,
sometimes hyaline-spotted or yellowish on the disk, shining when dry, margin
straight. Flesh white, taste mild, odor pleasant.</p>

<p>The gills are nearly free when young, then emarginate, somewhat crowded,
rather thick, entire, white.</p>

<p>The stem is solid, bare, subbulbose, even, white, dry. The spores are
8Ã—4Âµ.</p>

<p>The caps are two to four inches broad; the stem is two to four inches
long.&mdash;<i>Peck.</i></p>

<p>This is a beautiful plant, entirely white, smell and taste pleasant, and found
in Poke Hollow and in the woods along Ralston's Run, near Chillicothe.</p>

<p>This plant is found very generally over the United States.</p>
